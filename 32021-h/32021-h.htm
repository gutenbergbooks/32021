<h3>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h3>

  <p>This edition has been carefully revised throughout, and owing to the
  great increase to our knowledge of the Natural History of some of the
  islands during the last twelve years considerable additions or
  alterations have been required. The more important of these changes are
  the following:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Chapter VII. The account of the migrations of animals and plants
  during and since the Glacial Epoch, has been modified to accord with
  newer information.</p>

  <p>Chapters VIII and IX. The discussion of the causes of Glacial Epochs
  and Mild Arctic Climates has been somewhat modified in view of the late
  Dr. Croll's remarks, and the argument rendered clearer.</p>

  <p>Chapter XIII. Several additions to the Fauna of the Galapagos have
  been noted.</p>

  <p>Chapter XV. Considerable additions have been made to this chapter
  embodying the recent discoveries of birds and insects new to the Sandwich
  Islands, while a much fuller account has been given of its highly
  peculiar and very interesting flora.</p>

  <p>Chapter XVI. Important additions and corrections have been made in the
  lists of peculiar British animals and plants embodying the most recent
  information.</p>

  <p>Chapter XVII. Very large additions have been made to the mammalia and
  birds of Borneo, and full lists of the peculiar species are given. <!--
  Page viii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageviii"></a>{viii}</span></p>

  <p>Chapter XVIII. A more accurate account is given of the birds of
  Japan.</p>

  <p>Chapter XIX. The recent additions to the mammals and birds of
  Madagascar are embodied in this chapter, and a fuller sketch is given of
  the rich and peculiar flora of the island.</p>

  <p>Chapter XXI. and XXII. Some important additions have been made to
  these chapters owing to more accurate information as to the depth of the
  sea around New Zealand, and to the discovery of abundant remains of
  fossil plants of the tertiary and cretaceous periods both in New Zealand
  and Australia.</p>

  <p>In the body of the work I have in each case acknowledged the valuable
  information given me by naturalists of eminence in their various
  departments, and I return my best thanks to all who have so kindly
  assisted me. I am however indebted in a special manner to one
  gentleman&mdash;Mr. Theo. D.&nbsp;A. Cockerell, now Curator of the Museum of
  the Jamaica Institute&mdash;who supplied me with a large amount of
  information by searching the most recent works in the scientific
  libraries, by personal inquiries among naturalists, and also by giving me
  the benefit of his own copious notes and observations. Without his
  assistance it would have been difficult for me to have made the present
  edition so full and complete as I hope it now is. In a work of such wide
  range, and dealing with so large a body of facts some errors will
  doubtless be detected, though, I trust few of importance.</p>

<h3>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h3>

  <p>The present volume is the result of four years' additional thought and
  research on the lines laid down in my <i>Geographical Distribution of
  Animals</i>, and may be considered as a popular supplement to and
  completion of that work.</p>

  <p>It is, however, at the same time a complete work in itself: and, from
  the mode of treatment adopted, it will, I hope, be well calculated to
  bring before the intelligent reader the wide scope and varied interest of
  this branch of natural history. Although some of the earlier chapters
  deal with the same questions as my former volumes, they are here treated
  from a different point of view; and as the discussion of them is more
  elementary and at the same time tolerably full, it is hoped that they
  will prove both instructive and interesting. The plan of my larger work
  required that <i>genera</i> only should be taken account of; in the
  present volume I often discuss the distribution of <i>species</i>, and
  this will help to render the work more intelligible to the unscientific
  reader.</p>

  <p>The full statement of the scope and object of the present essay given
  in the "Introductory" chapter, together with the "Summary" of the whole
  work and the general view of the more important arguments given in the
  "Conclusion," render it unnecessary for me to offer any further remarks
  on these points. I may, however, state <!-- Page x --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagex"></a>{x}</span>generally that, so far as I
  am able to judge, a real advance has here been made in the mode of
  treating problems in Geographical Distribution, owing to the firm
  establishment of a number of preliminary doctrines or "principles," which
  in many cases lead to a far simpler and yet more complete solution of
  such problems than have been hitherto possible. The most important of
  these doctrines are those which establish and define&mdash;(1) The former
  wide extension of all groups now discontinuous, as being a necessary
  result of "evolution"; (2) The permanence of the great features of the
  distribution of land and water on the earth's surface; and, (3) The
  nature and frequency of climatal changes throughout geological time.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I have now only to thank the many friends and correspondents who have
  given me information or advice. Besides those whose assistance is
  acknowledged in the body of the work, I am especially indebted to four
  gentlemen who have been kind enough to read over the proofs of chapters
  dealing with questions on which they have special knowledge, giving me
  the benefit of valuable emendations and suggestions. Mr. Edward R. Alston
  has looked over those parts of the earlier chapters which relate to the
  mammals of Europe and the North Temperate zone; Mr. S.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;J. Skertchley,
  of the Geological Survey, has read the chapters which discuss the glacial
  epoch and other geological questions; Professor A. Newton has looked over
  the passages referring to the birds of the Madagascar group; while Sir
  Joseph D. Hooker has given me the invaluable benefit of his remarks on my
  two chapters dealing with the New Zealand flora.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>When an Englishman travels by the nearest sea-route from Great Britain
  to Northern Japan he passes by countries very unlike his own, both in
  aspect and natural productions. The sunny isles of the Mediterranean, the
  sands and date-palms of Egypt, the arid rocks of Aden, the cocoa groves
  of Ceylon, the tiger-haunted jungles of Malacca and Singapore, the
  fertile plains and volcanic peaks of Luzon, the forest-clad mountains of
  Formosa, and the bare hills of China, pass successively in review; till
  after a circuitous voyage of thirteen thousand miles he finds himself at
  Hakodadi in Japan. He is now separated from his starting-point by the
  whole width of Europe and Northern Asia, by an almost endless succession
  of plains and mountains, arid deserts or icy plateaux, yet when he visits
  the interior of the country he sees so many familiar natural objects that
  he can hardly help fancying he is close to his home. He finds the woods
  and fields tenanted by tits, hedge-sparrows, wrens, wagtails, larks,
  redbreasts, <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page4"></a>{4}</span>thrushes, buntings, and house-sparrows, some
  absolutely identical with our own feathered friends, others so closely
  resembling them that it requires a practised ornithologist to tell the
  difference. If he is fond of insects he notices many butterflies and a
  host of beetles which, though on close examination they are found to be
  distinct from ours, are yet of the same general aspect, and seem just
  what might be expected in any part of Europe. There are also of course
  many birds and insects which are quite new and peculiar, but these are by
  no means so numerous or conspicuous as to remove the general impression
  of a wonderful resemblance between the productions of such remote islands
  as Britain and Yesso.</p>

  <p>Now let an inhabitant of Australia sail to New Zealand, a distance of
  less than thirteen hundred miles, and he will find himself in a country
  whose productions are totally unlike those of his own. Kangaroos and
  wombats there are none, the birds are almost all entirely new, insects
  are very scarce and quite unlike the handsome or strange Australian
  forms, while even the vegetation is all changed, and no gum-tree, or
  wattle, or grass-tree meets the traveller's eye.</p>

  <p>But there are some more striking cases even than this, of the
  diversity of the productions of countries not far apart. In the Malay
  Archipelago there are two islands, named Bali and Lombok, each about as
  large as Corsica, and separated by a strait only fifteen miles wide at
  its narrowest part. Yet these islands differ far more from each other in
  their birds and quadrupeds than do England and Japan. The birds of the
  one are extremely <i>unlike</i> those of the other, the difference being
  such as to strike even the most ordinary observer. Bali has red and green
  woodpeckers, barbets, weaver-birds, and black-and-white magpie-robins,
  none of which are found in Lombok, where, however, we find screaming
  cockatoos and friar-birds, and the strange mound-building megapodes,
  which are all equally unknown in Bali. Many of the kingfishers,
  crow-shrikes, and other birds, though of the same general form, are of
  very distinct species; and though a considerable number of birds are the
  same in both islands the difference <!-- Page 5 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>{5}</span>is none the less
  remarkable&mdash;as proving that mere distance is one of the least
  important of the causes which have determined the likeness or unlikeness
  in the animals of different countries.</p>

  <p>In the western hemisphere we find equally striking examples. The
  Eastern United States possess very peculiar and interesting plants and
  animals, the vegetation becoming more luxuriant as we go south but not
  altering in essential character, so that when we reach Alabama or Florida
  we still find ourselves in the midst of pines, oaks, sumachs, magnolias,
  vines, and other characteristic forms of the temperate flora; while the
  birds, insects, and land-shells are of the same general character with
  those found further north.<a name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  But if we now cross over the narrow strait, about fifty miles wide, which
  separates Florida from the Bahama Islands, we find ourselves in a totally
  different country, surrounded by a vegetation which is essentially
  tropical and generally identical with that of Cuba. The change is most
  striking, because there is little difference of climate, of soil, or
  apparently of position, to account for it; and when we find that the
  birds, the insects, and especially the land-shells of the Bahamas are
  almost all West Indian, while the North American types of plants and
  animals have almost all completely disappeared, we shall be convinced
  that such differences and resemblances cannot be due to existing
  conditions, but must depend upon laws and causes to which mere proximity
  of position offers no clue.</p>

  <p>Hardly less uncertain and irregular are the effects of climate. Hot
  countries usually differ widely from cold ones in all their organic
  forms; but the difference is by no means constant, nor does it bear any
  proportion to difference of temperature. Between frigid Canada and
  sub-tropical Florida there are less marked differences in the animal
  productions than between Florida and Cuba or Yucatan, so much more alike
  in climate and so much nearer together. So the differences between the
  birds and quadrupeds of temperate Tasmania and tropical North <!-- Page 6
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>{6}</span>Australia are
  slight and unimportant as compared with the enormous differences we find
  when we pass from the latter country to equally tropical Java. If we
  compare corresponding portions of different continents, we find no
  indication that the almost perfect similarity of climate and general
  conditions has any tendency to produce similarity in the animal world.
  The equatorial parts of Brazil and of the West Coast of Africa are almost
  identical in climate and in luxuriance of vegetation, but their animal
  life is totally diverse. In the former we have tapirs, sloths, and
  prehensile-tailed monkeys; in the latter elephants, antelopes, and
  man-like apes; while among birds, the toucans, chatterers, and
  humming-birds of Brazil are replaced by the plantain-eaters, bee-eaters,
  and sun-birds of Africa. Parts of South-temperate America, South Africa,
  and South Australia, correspond closely in climate; yet the birds and
  quadrupeds of these three districts are as completely unlike each other
  as those of any parts of the world that can be named.</p>

  <p>If we visit the great islands of the globe, we find that they present
  similar anomalies in their animal productions, for while some exactly
  resemble the nearest continents others are widely different. Thus the
  quadrupeds, birds and insects of Borneo correspond very closely to those
  of the Asiatic continent, while those of Madagascar are extremely unlike
  African forms, although the distance from the continent is less in the
  latter case than in the former. And if we compare the three great islands
  Sumatra, Borneo, and Celebes&mdash;lying as it were side by side in the
  same ocean&mdash;we find that the two former, although furthest apart,
  have almost identical productions, while the two latter, though closer
  together, are more unlike than Britain and Japan situated in different
  oceans and separated by the largest of the great continents.</p>

  <p>These examples will illustrate the kind of questions it is the object
  of the present work to deal with. Every continent, every country, and
  every island on the globe, offers similar problems of greater or less
  complexity and interest, and the time has now arrived when their solution
  can be attempted with some prospect of success. Many <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span>years study of this class
  of subjects has convinced me that there is no short and easy method of
  dealing with them; because they are, in their very nature, the visible
  outcome and residual product of the whole past history of the earth. If
  we take the organic productions of a small island, or of any very limited
  tract of country, such as a moderate-sized country parish, we have, in
  their relations and affinities&mdash;in the fact that they are
  <i>there</i> and others are <i>not</i> there, a problem which involves
  all the migrations of these species and their ancestral forms&mdash;all
  the vicissitudes of climate and all the changes of sea and land which
  have affected those migrations&mdash;the whole series of actions and
  reactions which have determined the preservation of some forms and the
  extinction of others,&mdash;in fact the whole history of the earth,
  inorganic and organic, throughout a large portion of geological time.</p>

  <p>We shall perhaps better exhibit the scope and complexity of the
  subject, and show that any intelligent study of it was almost impossible
  till quite recently, if we concisely enumerate the great mass of facts
  and the number of scientific theories or principles which are necessary
  for its elucidation.</p>

  <p>We require then in the first place an adequate knowledge of the fauna
  and flora of the whole world, and even a detailed knowledge of many parts
  of it, including the islands of more special interest and their adjacent
  continents. This kind of knowledge is of very slow growth, and is still
  very imperfect;<a name="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and in
  many cases it can <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>{8}</span>never now be obtained owing to the reckless
  destruction of forests and with them of countless species of plants and
  animals. In the next place we require a true and natural classification
  of animals and plants, so that we may know their real affinities; and it
  is only now that this is being generally arrived at. We further have to
  make use of the theory of "descent with modification" as the only
  possible key to the interpretation of the facts of distribution, and this
  theory has only been generally accepted within the last twenty years. It
  is evident that, so long as the belief in "special creations" of each
  species prevailed, no explanation of the complex facts of distribution
  <i>could</i> be arrived at or even conceived; for if each species was
  created where it is now found no further inquiry can take us beyond that
  fact, and there is an end of the whole matter. Another important factor
  in our interpretation of the phenomena of distribution, is a knowledge of
  the extinct forms that have inhabited each country during the tertiary
  and secondary periods of geology. New facts of this kind are daily coming
  to light, but except as regards Europe, North America, and parts of
  India, they are extremely scanty; and even in the best-known countries
  the record itself is often very defective and fragmentary. Yet we have
  already obtained remarkable evidence of the migrations of many animals
  and plants in past ages, throwing an often unexpected light on the actual
  distribution of many groups.<a name="NtA_3"
  href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> By this means alone can we obtain
  positive evidence of the past migrations of organisms; and when, as too
  frequently is the case, this is altogether wanting, we <!-- Page 9
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>{9}</span>have to trust to
  collateral evidence and more or less probable hypothetical explanations.
  Hardly less valuable is the evidence of stratigraphical geology; for this
  often shows us what parts of a country have been submerged at certain
  epochs, and thus enables us to prove that certain areas have been long
  isolated and the fauna and flora allowed time for special development.
  Here, too, our knowledge is exceedingly imperfect, though the blanks upon
  the geological map of the world are yearly diminishing in extent. Lastly,
  as a most valuable supplement to geology, we require to know
  approximately, the depth and contour of the ocean-bed, since this affords
  an important clue to the former existence of now-submerged lands, uniting
  islands to continents, or affording intermediate stations which have
  aided the migrations of many organisms. This kind of information has only
  been partially obtained during the last few years; and it will be seen in
  the latter part of this volume, that some of the most recent deep-sea
  soundings have afforded a basis for an explanation of one of the most
  difficult and interesting questions in geographical biology&mdash;the
  origin of the fauna and flora of New Zealand.</p>

  <p>Such are the various classes of evidence that bear directly on the
  question of the distribution of organisms; but there are others of even a
  more fundamental character, and the importance of which is only now
  beginning to be recognised by students of nature. These are, firstly, the
  wonderful alterations of climate which have occurred in the temperate and
  polar zones, as proved by the evidences of glaciation in the one and of
  luxuriant vegetation in the other; and, secondly, the theory of the
  permanence of existing continents and oceans. If glacial epochs in
  temperate lands and mild climates near the poles have, as now believed by
  men of eminence, occurred several times over in the past history of the
  earth, the effects of such great and repeated changes, both on the
  migration, modification, and extinction, of species, must have been of
  overwhelming importance&mdash;of more importance perhaps than even the
  geological changes of sea and land. It is therefore necessary to consider
  the evidence for these climatal changes; <!-- Page 10 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>{10}</span>and then, by a critical
  examination of their possible causes, to ascertain whether they were
  isolated phenomena, were due to recurrent cosmical actions, or were the
  result of a great system of terrestrial development. The latter is the
  conclusion we arrive at; and this conclusion brings with it the
  conviction, that in the theory which accounts for both glacial epochs and
  warm polar climates, we have the key to explain and harmonize many of the
  most anomalous biological and geological phenomena, and one which is
  especially valuable for the light it throws on the dispersal and existing
  distribution of organisms. The other important theory, or rather
  corollary from the preceding theory&mdash;that of the permanence of
  oceans and the general stability of <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `sontinents'.">continents</span> throughout all
  geological time, is as yet very imperfectly understood, and seems, in
  fact, to many persons in the nature of a paradox. The evidence for it,
  however, appears to me to be conclusive; and it is certainly the most
  fundamental question in regard to the subject we have to deal with:
  since, if we once admit that continents and oceans may have changed
  places over and over again (as many writers maintain), we lose all power
  of reasoning on the migrations of ancestral forms of life, and are at the
  mercy of every wild theorist who chooses to imagine the former existence
  of a now-submerged continent to explain the existing distribution of a
  group of frogs or a genus of beetles.</p>

  <p>As already shown by the illustrative examples adduced in this chapter,
  some of the most remarkable and interesting facts in the distribution and
  affinities of organic forms are presented by islands in relation to each
  other and to the surrounding continents. The study of the productions of
  the Galapagos&mdash;so peculiar, and yet so decidedly related to the
  American continent&mdash;appears to have had a powerful influence in
  determining the direction of Mr. Darwin's researches into the origin of
  species; and every naturalist who studies them has always been struck by
  the unexpected relations or singular anomalies which are so often found
  to characterize the fauna and flora of islands. Yet their full importance
  in connection with the history of the earth and its inhabitants has
  hardly yet <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page11"></a>{11}</span>been recognised; and it is in order to
  direct the attention of naturalists to this most promising field of
  research, that I restrict myself in this volume to an elucidation of some
  of the problems they present to us. By far the larger part of the islands
  of the globe are but portions of continents undergoing some of the
  various changes to which they are ever subject; and the correlative
  proposition, that every portion of our continents has again and again
  passed through insular conditions, has not been sufficiently considered,
  but is, I believe, the statement of a great and most suggestive truth,
  and one which lies at the foundation of all accurate conception of the
  physical and organic changes which have resulted in the present state of
  the earth.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The indications now given of the scope and purpose of the present
  volume renders it evident that, before we can proceed to the discussion
  of the remarkable phenomena presented by insular faunas and floras, and
  the complex causes which have produced them, we must go through a series
  of preliminary studies, adapted to give us a command of the more
  important facts and principles on which the solution of such problems
  depends. The succeeding eight chapters will therefore be devoted to the
  explanation of the mode of distribution, variation, modification, and
  dispersal, of species and groups, illustrated by facts and examples; of
  the true nature of geological change as affecting continents and islands;
  of changes of climate, their nature, causes, and effects; of the duration
  of geological time and the rate of organic development.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE ELEMENTARY FACTS OF DISTRIBUTION</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

</blockquote>

  <p>So long as it was believed that the several species of animals and
  plants were "special creations," and had been formed expressly to inhabit
  the countries in which they are now found, their habitat was an ultimate
  fact which required no explanation. It was assumed that every animal was
  <i>exactly</i> adapted to the climate and surroundings amid which it
  lived, and that the only, or, at all events, the chief reason why it did
  not inhabit another country was, that the climate or general conditions
  of that country were not suitable to it, but in what the unsuitability
  consisted we could rarely hope to discover. Hence the exact locality of
  any species was not thought of much importance from a scientific point of
  view, and the idea that anything could be learnt by a comparative study
  of different floras and faunas never entered the minds of the older
  naturalists.</p>

  <p>But so soon as the theory of evolution came to be generally adopted,
  and it was seen that each animal could only have come into existence in
  some area where ancestral <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page13"></a>{13}</span>forms closely allied to it already lived, a
  real and important relation was established between an animal and its
  native country, and a new set of problems at once sprang into existence.
  From the old point of view the <i>diversities</i> of animal life in the
  separate continents, even where physical conditions were almost
  identical, was the fact that excited astonishment; but seen by the light
  of the evolution theory, it is the <i>resemblances</i> rather than the
  diversities in these distant continents and islands that are most
  difficult to explain. It thus comes to be admitted that a knowledge of
  the exact area occupied by a species or a group is a real portion of its
  natural history, of as much importance as its habits, its structure, or
  its affinities; and that we can never arrive at any trustworthy
  conclusions as to how the present state of the organic world was brought
  about, until we have ascertained with some accuracy the general laws of
  the distribution of living things over the earth's surface.</p>

  <p><i>Areas of Distribution.</i>&mdash;Every species of animal has a
  certain area of distribution to which, as a rule, it is permanently
  confined, although, no doubt, the limits of its range fluctuate somewhat
  from year to year, and in some exceptional cases may be considerably
  altered in a few years or centuries. Each species is moreover usually
  limited to one continuous area, over the whole of which it is more or
  less frequently to be met with, but there are many apparent and some real
  exceptions to this rule. Some animals are so adapted to certain kinds of
  country&mdash;as to forests or marshes, mountains or deserts&mdash;that
  they cannot, permanently, live elsewhere. These may be found scattered
  over a wide area in suitable spots only, but can hardly on that account
  be said to have several distinct areas of distribution. As an example we
  may name the chamois, which lives only on high mountains, but is found in
  the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Carpathians, in some of the Greek mountains
  and the Caucasus. The variable hare is another and more remarkable case,
  being found all over Northern Europe and Asia beyond lat. 55°, and also
  in Scotland and Ireland. In central Europe it is unknown till we come to
  the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the Caucasus, where it again appears. This is
  one of the best cases known of the <!-- Page 14 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>{14}</span>discontinuous
  distribution of a <i>species</i>, there being a gap of about a thousand
  miles between its southern limits in Russia, and its reappearance in the
  Alps. There are of course numerous instances in which species occur in
  two or more islands, or in an island and continent, and are thus rendered
  discontinuous by the sea, but these involve questions of changes in sea
  and land which we shall have to consider further on. Other cases are
  believed to exist of still wider separation of a species, as with the
  marsh titmice and the reed buntings of Europe and Japan, where similar
  forms are found in the extreme localities, while distinct varieties or
  sub-species, inhabit the intervening districts.</p>

  <p><i>Extent and Limitations of Specific Areas.</i>&mdash;Leaving for the
  present these cases of want of continuity in a species, we find the most
  wide difference between the extent of country occupied, varying in fact
  from a few square miles to almost the entire land surface of the globe.
  Among the mammalia, however, the same species seldom inhabits both the
  old and new worlds, unless they are strictly arctic animals, as the
  reindeer, the elk, the arctic fox, the glutton, the ermine, and some
  others. The common wolf of Europe and Northern Asia is thought by many
  naturalists to be identical with the variously coloured wolves of North
  America extending from the Arctic Ocean to Mexico, in which case this
  will have perhaps the widest range of any species of mammal. Little doubt
  exists as to the identity of the brown bears and the beavers of Europe
  and North America; but all these species range up to the arctic circle,
  and there is no example of a mammal universally admitted to be identical
  yet confined to the temperate zones of the two hemispheres. Among the
  undisputed species of mammalia the leopard has an enormous range,
  extending all over Africa and South Asia to Borneo and the east of China,
  and thus having probably the widest range of any known mammal. The winged
  mammalia have not usually very wide ranges, there being only one bat
  common to the Old and New Worlds. This is a British species, <i>Vesperugo
  serotinus</i>, which is found over the larger part of North America,
  Europe and Asia, as far <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page15"></a>{15}</span>as Pekin, and even extends into tropical
  Africa, thus rivalling the leopard and the wolf in the extent of country
  it occupies.</p>

  <p>Of very restricted ranges there are many examples, but some of these
  are subject to doubts as to the distinctness of the species or as to its
  geographical limits being really known. In Europe we have a distinct
  species of ibex (<i>Capra Pyrenaica</i>) confined to the Pyrenean
  mountains, while the true marmot is restricted to the Alpine range. More
  remarkable is the Pyrenean water-mole (<i>Mygale Pyrenaica</i>), a
  curious small insectivorous animal found only in a few places in the
  northern valleys of the Pyrenees. In islands there are many cases of
  undoubted restriction of species to a small area, but these involve a
  different question from the range of species on continents where there is
  no <i>apparent</i> obstacle to their wider extension.</p>

  <p><i>Specific range of Birds.</i>&mdash;Among birds we find instances of
  much wider range of species, which is only what might be expected
  considering their powers of flight; but, what is very curious, we also
  find more striking (though perhaps not more frequent) examples of extreme
  limitation of range among birds than among mammals. Of the former
  phenomenon perhaps the most remarkable case is that afforded by the
  osprey or fishing-hawk, which ranges over the greater portion of all the
  continents, as far as Brazil, South Africa, the Malay Islands, and
  Tasmania. The barn owl (<i>Strix flammea</i>) has nearly as wide a range,
  but in this case there is more diversity of opinion as to the specific
  difference of many of the forms inhabiting remote countries, some of
  which seem undoubtedly to be distinct. Among passerine birds the raven
  has probably the widest range, extending from the arctic regions to Texas
  and New Mexico in America, and to North India and Lake Baikal in Asia;
  while the little northern willow-wren (<i>Phylloscopus borealis</i>)
  ranges from arctic Norway across Asia to Alaska, and southward to Ceylon,
  China, Borneo, and Timor.</p>

  <p>Of very restricted continental ranges the best examples in Europe are,
  the little blue magpie (<i>Cyanopica cooki</i>) confined to the central
  portions of the Spanish peninsula; and the Italian sparrow found only in
  Italy and Corsica. <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page16"></a>{16}</span>In Asia, Palestine affords some examples of
  birds of very restricted range&mdash;a beautiful sun-bird (<i>Nectarinea
  osea</i>) a peculiar starling (<i>Amydrus tristramii</i>) and some
  others, being almost or quite confined to the warmer portions of the
  valley of the Jordan. In the Himalayas there are numbers of birds which
  have very restricted ranges, but those of the Neilgherries are perhaps
  better known, several species of laughing thrushes and some other birds
  being found only on the summits of these mountains. The most wonderfully
  restricted ranges are, however, to be found among the humming-birds of
  tropical America. The great volcanic peaks of Chimborazo and Pichincha
  have each a peculiar species of humming-bird confined to a belt just
  below the limits of perpetual snow, while the extinct volcano of Chiriqui
  in Veragua has a species confined to its wooded crater. One of the most
  strange and beautiful of the humming-birds (<i>Loddigesia mirabilis</i>)
  was obtained once only, more than forty years ago, near Chachapoyas in
  the Andes of northern Peru; and though Mr. Gould sent many drawings of
  the bird to people visiting the district and for many years offered a
  high reward for a specimen, no other has ever been seen!<a name="NtA_4"
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The above details will sufficiently explain what is meant by the
  "specific area" or range of a species. The very wide and very narrow
  ranges are exceptional, the great majority of species both of mammals and
  birds ranging over moderately wide areas, which present no striking
  contrasts in climate and physical conditions. Thus a large proportion of
  European birds range over the whole continent in an east and west
  direction, but considerable numbers are restricted either to the northern
  or the southern half. In Africa some species range over all the continent
  south of the desert, while large numbers are restricted to the equatorial
  forests, or to the upland plains. In North America, if we exclude the
  tropical and the arctic portions, a considerable number of species range
  over all the temperate parts of the continent, while still <!-- Page 17
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>{17}</span>more are
  restricted to the east, the centre, or the west, respectively.</p>

  <p><i>Generic Areas.</i>&mdash;Having thus obtained a tolerably clear
  idea of the main facts as to the distribution of isolated species, let us
  now consider those collections of closely-allied species termed genera.
  What a genus is will be sufficiently understood by a few illustrations.
  All the different kinds of dogs, jackals, and wolves belong to the dog
  genus, Canis; the tiger, lion, leopard, jaguar, and the wild cats, to the
  cat genus, Felis; the blackbird, song-thrush, missel-thrush, fieldfare,
  and many others to the thrush genus, Turdus; the crow, rook, raven, and
  jackdaw, to the crow genus, Corvus; but the magpie belongs to another,
  though closely-allied genus, Pica, distinguished by the different form
  and proportions of its wings and tail from all the species of the crow
  genus. The number of species in a genus varies greatly, from one up to
  several hundreds. The giraffe, the glutton, the walrus, the bearded
  reedling, the secretary-bird, and many others, have no close allies, and
  each forms a genus by itself. The beaver genus, Castor, and the camel
  genus, Camelus, each consist of two species. On the other hand, the deer
  genus, Cervus has forty species; the mouse and rat genus, Mus more than a
  hundred species; and there is about the same number of the thrush genus;
  while among the lower classes of animals genera are often very extensive,
  the fine genus Papilio, or swallow-tailed butterflies, containing more
  than four hundred species; and Cicindela, which includes our native tiger
  beetles, has about the same number. Many genera of shells are very
  extensive, and one of them&mdash;the genus Helix, including the commonest
  snails, and ranging all over the world&mdash;is probably the most
  extensive in the animal kingdom, numbering about two thousand described
  species.<a name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Separate and Overlapping Areas.</i>&mdash;The species of a genus
  are distributed in two ways. Either they occupy distinct areas which do
  not touch each other and are sometimes widely separated, or they touch
  and occasionally overlap <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page18"></a>{18}</span>each other, each species occupying an area
  of its own which rarely coincides exactly with that of any other species
  of the same genus. In some cases, when a river, a mountain-chain, or a
  change of conditions as from pasture to desert or forest, determines the
  range of species, the areas of two species of the same genus may just
  meet, one beginning where the other ends; but this is comparatively rare.
  It occurs, however, in the Amazon valley, where several species of
  monkeys, birds, and insects come up to the south bank of the river but do
  not pass it, while allied species come to the north bank, which in like
  manner forms their boundary. As examples we may mention that one of the
  Saki monkeys (<i>Pithecia monachus?</i>) comes up to the south bank of
  the Upper Amazon, while immediately we cross over to the north bank we
  find another species (<i>Pithecia rufibarbata?</i>). Among birds we have
  the green jacamar (<i>Galbula viridis</i>), abundant on the north bank of
  the Lower Amazon, while on the south bank we have two allied species
  (<i>Galbula rufoviridis</i> and <i>G. cyaneicollis</i>); and among
  insects we have at Santarem on the south bank of the Amazon, the
  beautiful blue butterfly, <i>Callithea sapphira</i>, while almost
  opposite to it, at Monte-alegre, an allied species, <i>Callithea
  Leprieuri</i> is alone found. Perhaps the most interesting and best known
  case of a series of allied species, whose ranges are separate but
  conterminous, is that of the beautiful South American wading birds,
  called trumpeters, and forming the genus Psophia. There are five species,
  all found in the Amazon valley, but each limited to a well-marked
  district bounded by great rivers. On the north bank of the Amazon there
  are two species, one in its lower valley extending up to the Rio Negro;
  and the other in the central part of the valley beyond that river; while
  to the south of the Amazon there are three, one above the Madeira, one
  below it, and a third near Para, probably separated from the last by the
  Tocantins river.</p>

  <p>Overlapping areas among the species of a genus is a more common
  phenomenon, and is almost universal where these species are numerous in
  the same continent. It is, however, exceedingly irregular, so that we
  often find one <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page19"></a>{19}</span>species extending over a considerable
  portion of the area occupied by the genus and including the entire areas
  of some of the other species. So little has been done to work out
  accurately the limits of species that it is very difficult to give
  examples. One of the best is to be found in the genus
  <i>Dendr&oelig;ca</i>, a group of American wood-warblers. These little
  birds all migrate in the winter into the tropical regions, but in the
  summer they come north, each having its particular range. Thus, <i>D.
  dominica</i> comes as far as the middle Eastern States, <i>D.
  c&oelig;rulea</i> keeps west of the Alleghanies, <i>D. discolor</i> comes
  to Michigan and New England; four other species go farther north in
  Canada, while several extend to the borders of the Arctic zone.</p>

  <p><i>The Species of Tits as Illustrating Areas of
  Distribution.</i>&mdash;In our own hemisphere the overlapping of allied
  species may be well illustrated by the various kinds of titmice,
  constituting the genus Parus, several of which are among our best known
  English birds. The great titmouse (<i>Parus major</i>) has the widest
  range of all, extending from the Arctic circle to Algeria, Palestine, and
  Persia, and from Ireland right across Siberia to the Ochotsk sea,
  probably following the great northern forest belt. It does not extend
  into China and Japan, where distinct species are found. Next in extent of
  range is the coal tit (<i>Parus ater</i>) which inhabits all Europe from
  the Mediterranean to about 64° N. latitude, in Asia Minor to the Lebanon
  and Caucasus, and across Siberia to Amoorland and Japan. The marsh tit
  (<i>Parus palustris</i>) inhabits temperate and south Europe from 61° N.
  latitude in Norway to Poland and South-west Russia, and in the south from
  Spain to Asia Minor. Closely allied to this&mdash;of which it is probably
  only a variety or sub-species&mdash;is the northern marsh tit (<i>Parus
  borealis</i>), which overlaps the last in Norway and Sweden, and also in
  South Russia and the Alps, but extends further north into Lapland and
  North Russia, and thence probably in a south-easterly direction across
  Central Asia to North China. Yet another closely-allied species (<i>Parus
  camtschatkensis</i>) ranges from North-eastern Russia across Northern
  Siberia to Lake Baikal and to Hakodadi in Japan, thus overlapping
  <i>Parus borealis</i> in the <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page20"></a>{20}</span>western portion of its area. Our little
  favourite, the blue tit (<i>Parus c&oelig;ruleus</i>) ranges over all
  Europe from the Arctic circle to the Mediterranean, and on to Asia Minor
  and Persia, but does not seem to pass beyond the Ural mountains. Its
  lovely eastern ally the azure tit (<i>Parus cyaneus</i>) overlaps the
  range of <i>P. c&oelig;ruleus</i> in Western Europe as far as St.
  Petersburg and Austria, rarely straggling to Denmark, while it stretches
  all across Central Asia between the latitudes 35° and 56° N. as far as
  the Amoor valley. Besides these wide-ranging species there are several
  others which are more restricted. <i>Parus teneriffæ</i>, a beautiful
  dark blue form of our blue tit, inhabits North-west Africa and the
  Canaries; <i>Parus ledouci</i>, closely allied to our coal tit, is found
  only in Algeria; <i>Parus lugubris</i>, allied to the marsh tit, is
  confined to South-east Europe and Asia Minor, from Hungary and South
  Russia to Palestine; and <i>Parus cinctus</i>, another allied form, is
  confined to the extreme north in Lapland, Finland, and perhaps Northern
  Russia and Siberia. Another beautiful little bird, the crested titmouse
  (<i>Parus cristatus</i>) is sometimes placed in a separate genus. It
  inhabits nearly all Central and South Europe, wherever there are pine
  forests, from 64° N. latitude to Austria and North Italy, and in the west
  to Spain and Gibraltar, while in the east it does not pass the Urals and
  the Caucasus range. Its nearest allies are in the high Himalayas.</p>

  <p>These are all the European tits, but there are many others inhabiting
  Asia, Africa, and North America; so that the genus Parus has a very wide
  range, in Asia to Ceylon and the Malay Islands, in Africa to the Cape,
  and in North America to the highlands of Mexico.</p>

  <p><i>The Distribution of the Species of Jays.</i>&mdash;Owing to the
  very wide range of several of the tits, the uncertainty of the specific
  distinction of others, and the difficulty in many cases of ascertaining
  their actual distribution, it has not been found practicable to
  illustrate this genus by means of a map. For this purpose we have chosen
  the genus Garrulus or the jays, in which the species are less numerous,
  the specific areas less extensive, and the species generally better
  defined; while being large and handsome <!-- Page 21 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>{21}</span>birds they are sure to
  have been collected, or at least noticed, wherever they occur. There are,
  so far as yet known, twelve species of true jays, occupying an area
  extending from Western Europe to Eastern Asia and Japan, and nowhere
  passing the Arctic circle to the north, or the tropic of Cancer to the
  south, so that they constitute one of the most typical of the
  Palæarctic<a name="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> genera. The
  following are the species, beginning with the most westerly and
  proceeding towards the east. The numbers prefixed to each species
  correspond to those on the coloured map which forms the frontispiece to
  this volume.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Garrulus glandarius.</i>&mdash;The common jay, inhabits the
  British Isles and all Europe except the extreme north, extending also
  into North Africa, where it has been observed in many parts of Algeria.
  It occurs near Constantinople, but apparently not in Asia Minor; and in
  Russia, up to, but not beyond, the Urals. The jays being woodland birds
  are not found in open plains or barren uplands, and their distribution is
  hence by no means uniform within the area they actually occupy.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Garrulus cervicalis.</i>&mdash;The Algerian jay, is a very
  distinct species inhabiting a limited area in North Africa, and found in
  some places along with the common species.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Garrulus krynicki.</i>&mdash;The black-headed jay, is closely
  allied to the common species, but quite distinct, inhabiting a
  comparatively small area in South-eastern Europe, and Western Asia.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Garrulus atricapillus.</i>&mdash;The Syrian jay, is very closely
  allied to the last, and inhabits an adjoining area in Syria, Palestine,
  and Southern Persia.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Garrulus hyrcanus.</i>&mdash;The Persian jay, is a small species
  allied to our jay and only known from the Elburz Mountains in the north
  of Persia.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Garrulus brandti.</i>&mdash;Brandt's jay, is a very distinct
  species, having an extensive range across Asia from the Ural Mountains to
  North China, Mandchuria, and the northern island of Japan, and also
  crossing the Urals into <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page22"></a>{22}</span>Russia where it has been found as far west
  as Kazan in districts where the common jay also occurs.</p>

  <p>7. <i>Garrulus lanceolatus.</i>&mdash;The black-throated jay, is a
  very distinct form known only from the North-western Himalayas and Nepal,
  common about Simla, and extending into Cashmere beyond the range of the
  next species.</p>

  <p>8. <i>Garrulus bispecularis.</i>&mdash;The Himalayan jay is also very
  distinct, having the head coloured like the back, and not striped as in
  all the western species. It inhabits the Himalayas east of Cashmere, but
  is more abundant in the western than the eastern division, though
  according to the Abbé David it reaches Moupin in East Thibet.</p>

  <p>9. <i>Garrulus sinensis.</i>&mdash;The Chinese jay, is very closely
  allied to the Himalayan, of which it is sometimes classed as a
  sub-species. It seems to be found in all the southern mountains of China,
  from Foochow on the east to Sze-chuen and East Thibet on the west, as it
  is recorded from Moupin by the Abbé David as well as the Himalayan
  bird&mdash;a tolerable proof that it is a distinct form.</p>

  <p>10. <i>Garrulus taivanus.</i>&mdash;The Formosan jay is a very close
  ally of the preceding, confined to the island of Formosa.</p>

  <p>11. <i>Garrulus japonicus.</i>&mdash;The Japanese jay is nearly allied
  to our common British species, being somewhat smaller and less brightly
  coloured, and with black orbits; yet these are the most widely separated
  species of the genus. According to Mr. Seebohm this species is equally
  allied to the Chinese and Siberian jays.</p>

  <p>In the accompanying map (see frontispiece) we have laid down the
  distribution of each species so far as it can be ascertained from the
  works of Sharpe and Dresser for Europe, Jerdon for India, Swinhoe for
  China, and Mr. Seebohm's recent work for Japan. There is, however, much
  uncertainty in many places, and gaps have to be filled up conjecturally,
  while such a large part of Asia is still very imperfectly explored, that
  considerable modifications may have to be made when the country becomes
  more accurately known. But though details may be modified we can hardly
  suppose that the great features of the several specific areas, or their
  relations to each other <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page23"></a>{23}</span>will be much affected; and these are what we
  have chiefly to consider as bearing on the questions here discussed.</p>

  <p>The first thing that strikes us on looking at the map, is, the small
  amount of overlapping of the several areas, and the isolation of many of
  the species; while the next most striking feature is the manner in which
  the Asiatic species almost surround a vast area in which no jays are
  found. The only species with large areas, are the European <i>G.
  glandarius</i> and the Asiatic <i>G. Brandti</i>. The former has three
  species overlapping it&mdash;in Algeria, in South-eastern and
  North-eastern Europe respectively. The Syrian jay (No. 4), is not known
  to occur anywhere with the black-headed jay (No. 3), and perhaps the two
  areas do not meet. The Persian jay (No. 5), is quite isolated. The
  Himalayan and Chinese jays (Nos. 7, 8, and 9) form a group which are
  isolated from the rest of the genus; while the Japanese jay (No. 11), is
  also completely isolated as regards the European jays to which it is
  nearly allied. These peculiarities of distribution are no doubt in part
  dependent on the habits of the jays, which live only in well-wooded
  districts, among deciduous trees, and are essentially non-migratory in
  their habits, though sometimes moving southwards in winter. This will
  explain their absence from the vast desert area of Central Asia, but it
  will not account for the gap between the North and South Chinese species,
  nor for the absence of jays from the wooded hills of Turkestan, where Mr.
  N.&nbsp;A. Severtzoff collected assiduously, obtaining 384 species of birds
  but no jay. These peculiarities, and the fact that jays are never very
  abundant anywhere, seem to indicate that the genus is now a decaying one,
  and that it has at no very distant epoch occupied a larger and more
  continuous area, such as that of the genus Parus at the present day.</p>

  <p><i>Discontinuous generic Areas.</i>&mdash;It is not very easy to find
  good examples of genera whose species occupy two or more quite
  disconnected areas, for though such cases may not be rare, we are seldom
  in a position to mark out the limits of the several species with
  sufficient accuracy. The best and most remarkable case among European
  birds is <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page24"></a>{24}</span>that of the blue magpies, forming the genus
  Cyanopica. One species (<i>C. cooki</i>) is confined (as already stated)
  to the wooded and mountainous districts of Spain and Portugal, while the
  only other species of the genus (<i>C. cyanus</i>) is found far away in
  North-eastern Asia and Japan, so that the two species are separated by
  about 5,000 miles of continuous land. Another case is that of the curious
  little water-moles forming the genus Mygale, one species <i>M.
  muscovitica</i>, being found only on the banks of the Volga and Don in
  South-eastern Russia, while the other, <i>M. pyrenaica</i>, is confined
  to streams on the northern side of the Pyrenees. In tropical America
  there are four different kinds of bell-birds belonging to the genus
  Chasmorhynchus, each of which appears to inhabit a restricted area
  completely separated from the others. The most northerly is <i>C.
  tricarunculatus</i> of Costa Rica and Veragua, a brown bird with a white
  head and three long caruncles growing upwards at the base of the beak.
  Next comes <i>C. variegatus</i>, in Venezuela, a white bird with a brown
  head and numerous caruncles on the throat, perhaps conterminous with the
  last; in Guiana, extending to near the mouth of the Rio Negro, we have
  <i>C. niveus</i>, the bell-bird described by Waterton, which is pure
  white, with a single long fleshy caruncle at the base of the beak; the
  last species, <i>C. nudicollis</i>, inhabits South-east Brazil, and is
  also white, but with black stripes over the eyes, and with a naked
  throat. These birds are about the size of thrushes, and are all
  remarkable for their loud, ringing notes, like a bell or a blow on an
  anvil, as well as for their peculiar colours. They are therefore known to
  the native Indians wherever they exist, and we may be the more sure that
  they do not spread over the intervening areas where they have never been
  found, and where the natives know nothing of them.</p>

  <p>A good example of isolated species of a group nearer home, is afforded
  by the snow-partridges of the genus Tetraogallus. One species inhabits
  the Caucasus range and nowhere else, keeping to the higher slopes from
  6,000 to 11,000 feet above the sea, and accompanying the ibex in its
  wanderings, as both feed on the same plants. Another <!-- Page 25
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>{25}</span>has a wider
  range in Asia Minor and Persia, from the Taurus mountains to the
  South-east corner of the Caspian Sea; a third species inhabits the
  Western Himalayas, between the forests and perpetual snow, extending
  eastwards to Nepal; while a fourth is found on the north side of the
  mountains in Thibet, and the ranges of these two perhaps overlap; the
  last species inhabit the Altai mountains, and like the two first appears
  to be completely separated from all its allies.</p>

  <p>There are some few still more extraordinary cases in which the species
  of one genus are separated in remote continents or islands. The most
  striking of these is that of the tapirs, forming the genus Tapirus, of
  which there are two or three species in South America, and one very
  distinct species in Malacca and Borneo, separated by nearly half the
  circumference of the globe. Another example among quadrupeds is a
  peculiar genus of moles named Urotrichus, of which one species inhabits
  Japan and the other British Columbia. The cuckoo-like honey-guides,
  forming the genus Indicator, are tolerably abundant in tropical Africa,
  but there are two outlying species, one in the Eastern Himalaya
  mountains, the other in Borneo, both very rare, and recently an allied
  species has been found in the Malay peninsula. The beautiful blue and
  green thrush-tits forming the genus Cochoa, have two species in the
  Eastern Himalayas and Eastern China, while the third is confined to Java;
  the curious genus Eupetes, supposed to be allied to the dippers, has one
  species in Sumatra and Malacca, while four other species are found two
  thousand miles distant in New Guinea; lastly, the lovely ground-thrushes
  of the genus Pitta, range from Hindostan to Australia, while a single
  species, far removed from all its near allies, inhabits West Africa.</p>

  <p><i>Peculiarities of Generic, and Family Distribution.</i>&mdash;The
  examples now given sufficiently illustrate the mode in which the several
  species of a genus are distributed. We have next to consider genera as
  the component parts of families, and families of orders, from the same
  point of view. <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span></p>

  <p>All the phenomena presented by the species of a genus are reproduced
  by the genera of a family, and often in a more marked degree. Owing,
  however, to the extreme restriction of genera by modern naturalists,
  there are not many among the higher animals that have a world-wide
  distribution. Among the mammalia there is no such thing as a truly
  cosmopolitan genus. This is owing to the absence of all the higher orders
  except the mice from Australia, while the genus Mus, which occurs there,
  is represented by a distinct group, Hesperomys, in America. If, however,
  we consider the Australian dingo as a native animal we might class the
  genus Canis as cosmopolite, but the wild dogs of South America are now
  formed into separate genera by some naturalists. Many genera, however,
  range over three or more continents, as Felis (the cat genus) absent only
  from Australia; Ursus (the bear genus) absent from Australia and tropical
  Africa; Cervus (the deer genus) with nearly the same range; and Sciurus
  (the squirrel genus) found in all the continents but Australia. Among
  birds Turdus, the thrush, and Hirundo, the swallow genus, are the only
  perching birds which are truly cosmopolites; but there are many genera of
  hawks, owls, wading and swimming birds, which have a world-wide
  range.</p>

  <p>As a great many genera consist of single species there is no lack of
  cases of great restriction, such as the curious lemur called the "potto,"
  which is found only at Sierra Leone, and forms the genus Perodicticus;
  the true chinchillas found only in the Andes of Peru and Chili south of
  9° S. lat. and between 8,000 and 12,000 feet elevation; several genera of
  finches each confined to limited portions of the higher Himalayas, the
  blood-pheasants (Ithaginis) found only above 10,000 feet from Nepal to
  East Thibet; the bald-headed starling of the Philippine islands, the
  lyre-birds of East Australia, and a host of others.</p>

  <p>It is among the different genera of the same family that we meet with
  the most striking examples of discontinuity, although these genera are
  often as unmistakably allied as are the species of a genus; and it is
  these cases that furnish the most interesting problems to the student of
  distribution. <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>{27}</span>We must therefore consider them somewhat
  more fully.</p>

  <p>Among mammalia the most remarkable of these divided families is that
  of the camels, of which one genus Camelus, the true camels, comprising
  the camel and dromedary, is confined to Asia, while the other Auchenia,
  comprising the llamas and alpacas, is found only in the high Andes and in
  the plains of temperate South America. Not only are these two genera
  separated by the Atlantic and by the greater part of the land of two
  continents, but one is confined to the Northern and the other to the
  Southern hemisphere. The next case, though not so well known, is equally
  remarkable; it is that of the Centetidæ, a family of small insectivorous
  animals, which are wholly confined to Madagascar and the large West
  Indian islands Cuba and Hayti, the former containing five genera and the
  latter a single genus with a species in each island. Here again we have
  the whole continent of Africa as well as the Atlantic ocean separating
  allied genera. Two families (or subfamilies) of rat-like animals,
  Octodontidæ and Echimyidæ, are also divided by the Atlantic. Both are
  mainly South American, but the former has two genera in North and East
  Africa, and the latter also two in South and West Africa. Two other
  families of mammalia, though confined to the Eastern hemisphere, are yet
  markedly discontinuous. The Tragulidæ are small deer-like animals, known
  as chevrotains or mouse-deer, abundant in India and the larger Malay
  islands and forming the genus Tragulus; while another genus, Hyomoschus,
  is confined to West Africa. The other family is the Simiidæ or anthropoid
  apes, in which we have the gorilla and chimpanzee confined to West and
  Central Africa, while the allied orangs are found only in the islands of
  Sumatra and Borneo, the two groups being separated by a greater space
  than the Echimyidæ and other rodents of Africa and South America.</p>

  <p>Among birds and reptiles we have several families, which, from being
  found only within the tropics of Asia, Africa, and America, have been
  termed tropicopolitan groups. The Megalæmidæ or barbets are gaily
  coloured <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span>fruit-eating birds, almost equally abundant
  in tropical Asia and Africa, but less plentiful in America, where they
  probably suffer from the competition of the larger sized toucans. The
  genera of each country are distinct, but all are closely allied, the
  family being a very natural one. The trogons form a family of very
  gorgeously coloured and remarkable insect-eating birds very abundant in
  tropical America, less so in Asia, and with a single genus of two species
  in Africa.</p>

  <p>Among reptiles we have two families of snakes&mdash;the Dendrophidæ or
  tree-snakes, and the Dryiophidæ or green whip-snakes&mdash;which are also
  found in the three tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and America, but in
  these cases even some of the genera are common to Asia and Africa, or to
  Africa and America. The lizards forming the family Amphisbænidæ are
  divided between tropical Africa and America, a few species only occurring
  in the southern portion of the adjacent temperate regions; while even the
  peculiarly American family of the iguanas is represented by two genera in
  Madagascar, and one in the Fiji and Friendly Islands. Passing on to the
  Amphibians the worm-like Cæciliadæ are tropicopolitan, as are also the
  toads of the family Engystomatidæ. Insects also furnish some analogous
  cases, three genera of Cicindelidæ, (Pogonostoma, Ctenostoma, and
  Peridexia) showing a decided connection between this family in South
  America and Madagascar; while the beautiful family of diurnal moths,
  Uraniidæ, is confined to the same two countries. A somewhat similar but
  better known illustration is afforded by the two genera of ostriches, one
  confined to Africa and Arabia, the other to the plains of temperate South
  America.</p>

  <p><i>General features of Overlapping and Discontinuous
  Areas.</i>&mdash;These numerous examples of discontinuous genera and
  families form an important section of the facts of animal dispersal which
  any true theory must satisfactorily account for. In greater or less
  prominence they are to be found all over the world, and in every group of
  animals, and they grade imperceptibly into those cases of conterminous
  and overlapping areas which we have seen to <!-- Page 29 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>{29}</span>prevail in most extensive
  groups of species, and which are perhaps even more common in those large
  families which consist of many closely allied genera. A sufficient proof
  of the overlapping of generic areas is the occurrence of a number of
  genera of the same family together. Thus in France or Italy about twenty
  genera of warblers (Sylviadæ) are found, and as each of the thirty-three
  genera of this family inhabiting temperate Europe and Asia has a
  different area, a great number must here overlap. So, in most parts of
  Africa, at least ten or twelve genera of antelopes may be found, and in
  South America a large proportion of the genera of monkeys of the family
  Cebidæ occur in many districts; and still more is this the case with the
  larger bird families, such as the tanagers, the tyrant shrikes, or the
  tree-creepers, so that there is in all these extensive families no genus
  whose area does not overlap that of many others. Then among the
  moderately extensive families we find a few instances of one or two
  genera isolated from the rest, as the spectacled bear, Tremarctos, found
  only in Chili, while the remainder of the family extends from Europe and
  Asia over North America to the Mountains of Mexico, but no further south;
  the Bovidæ, or hollow-horned ruminants, which have a few isolated genera
  in the Rocky Mountains and the islands of Sumatra and Celebes; and from
  these we pass on to the cases of wide separation already given.</p>

  <p><i>Restricted Areas of Families.</i>&mdash;As families sometimes
  consist of single genera and even single species, they often present
  examples of very restricted range; but what is perhaps more interesting
  are those cases in which a family contains numerous species and sometimes
  even several genera, and yet is confined to a narrow area. Such are the
  golden moles (Chrysochloridæ) consisting of two genera and three species,
  confined to extratropical South Africa; the hill-tits (Liotrichidæ), a
  family of numerous genera and species mainly confined to the Himalayas,
  but with a few straggling species in the Malay countries and the
  mountains of China; the Pteroptochidæ, large wren-like birds, consisting
  of eight genera and nineteen species, almost entirely confined to
  temperate South America and <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page30"></a>{30}</span>the Andes; and the birds-of-paradise,
  consisting of nineteen or twenty genera and about thirty-five species,
  almost all inhabitants of New Guinea and the immediately surrounding
  islands, while a few, doubtfully belonging to the family, extend to East
  Australia. Among reptiles the most striking case of restriction is that
  of the rough-tailed burrowing snakes (Uropeltidæ), the five genera and
  eighteen species being strictly confined to Ceylon and the southern parts
  of the Indian Peninsula.</p>

  <p><i>The Distribution of Orders.</i>&mdash;When we pass to the larger
  groups, termed orders, comprising several families, we find comparatively
  few cases of restriction and many of worldwide distribution; and the
  families of which they are composed are strictly comparable to the genera
  of which families are composed, inasmuch as they present examples of
  overlapping, or conterminous, or isolated areas, though the latter are
  comparatively rare. Among mammalia the Insectivora offer the best example
  of an order, several of whose families inhabit areas more or less
  isolated from the rest; while the Marsupialia have six families in
  Australia, and one, the opossums, far off in America.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, more important is the limitation of some entire orders to
  certain well-defined portions of the globe. Thus the Proboscidea,
  comprising the single family and genus of the elephants, and the
  Hyracoidea, that of the Hyrax or Syrian coney, are confined to parts of
  Africa and Asia; the Marsupials to Australia and America; and the
  Monotremata, the lowest of all mammals&mdash;comprising the duck-billed
  Platypus and the spiny Echidna, to Australia and New Guinea. Among birds
  the Struthiones or ostrich tribe are almost confined to the three
  Southern continents, South America, Africa and Australia; and among
  Amphibia the tailed Batrachia&mdash;the newts and salamanders&mdash;are
  similarly restricted to the northern hemisphere.</p>

  <p>These various facts will receive their explanation in a future
  chapter.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Having now obtained some notion of how animals are dispersed over the
  earth's surface, whether as single species or as collected in those
  groups termed genera, families, and orders, it will be well, before
  proceeding further, to understand something of the classification of the
  facts we have been considering, and some of the simpler conclusions these
  facts lead to.</p>

  <p>We have hitherto described the distribution of species and groups of
  animals by means of the great geographical divisions of the globe in
  common use; but it will have been observed that in hardly any case do
  these define the limits of anything beyond species, and very seldom, or
  perhaps never, even those accurately. Thus the term "Europe" will not
  give, with any approach to accuracy, the range of any one genus of
  mammals or birds, and <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span>perhaps not that of half-a-dozen species.
  Either they range into Siberia, or Asia Minor, or Palestine, or North
  Africa; and this seems to be always the case when their area of
  distribution occupies a large portion of Europe. There are, indeed, a few
  species limited to Central or Western or Southern Europe, and these are
  almost the only cases in which we can use the word for zoological
  purposes without having to add to it some portion of another continent.
  Still less useful is the term Asia for this purpose, since there is
  probably no single animal or group confined to Asia which is not also
  more or less nearly confined to the tropical or the temperate portion of
  it. The only exception is perhaps the tiger, which may really be called
  an Asiatic animal, as it occupies nearly two-thirds of the continent; but
  this is an unique example, while the cases in which Asiatic animals and
  groups are strictly limited to a portion of Asia, or extend also into
  Europe or into Africa or to the Malay Islands, are exceedingly numerous.
  So, in Africa, very few groups of animals range over the whole of it
  without going beyond either into Europe or Asia Minor or Arabia, while
  those which are purely African are generally confined to the portion
  south of the tropic of Cancer. Australia and America are terms which
  better serve the purpose of the zoologist. The former defines the limit
  of many important groups of animals; and the same may be said of the
  latter, but the division into North and South America introduces
  difficulties, for almost all the groups especially characteristic of
  South America are found also beyond the isthmus of Panama, in what is
  geographically part of the northern continent.</p>

  <p>It being thus clear that the old and popular divisions of the globe
  are very inconvenient when used to describe the range of animals, we are
  naturally led to ask whether any other division can be made which will be
  more useful, and will serve to group together a considerable number of
  the facts we have to deal with. Such a division was made by Mr. P.&nbsp;L.
  Sclater more than twenty years ago, and it has, with some slight
  modifications, come into pretty general use in this country, and to some
  extent also <!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page33"></a>{33}</span>abroad; we shall therefore proceed to
  explain its nature and the principles on which it is established, as it
  will have to be often referred to in future chapters of this work, and
  will take the place of the old geographical divisions whose inconvenience
  has already been pointed out. The primary zoological divisions of the
  globe are called "regions," and we will begin by ascertaining the limits
  of the region of which our own country forms a part.</p>

  <p><i>The Range of British Mammals as indicating a Zoological
  Region.</i>&mdash;We will first take our commonest wild mammalia and see
  how far they extend, and especially whether they are confined to Europe
  or range over parts of other continents:</p>

</table>

  <p>We thus see that out of thirteen of our commonest quadrupeds only one
  is confined to Europe, while seven are found also in Northern Africa, and
  eleven range into Siberia, most of them stretching quite across Asia to
  the valley of the Amoor on the extreme eastern side of that continent.
  Two of the above-named British species, the fox and weasel, are also
  inhabitants of the New World, being as common in the northern parts of
  North America as they are with us; but with these exceptions the entire
  range of our commoner species is given, and they clearly show that all
  Northern Asia and Northern Africa must be added to Europe in order to
  form the region which they collectively inhabit. If now we go into
  Central Europe and take, for example, the quadrupeds of Germany, we shall
  find that these too, although much more numerous, are confined to the
  same limits, except that some of the <!-- Page 34 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span>more arctic kinds, as
  already stated, extend into the colder regions of North America.</p>

  <p><i>Range of East Asian and North African Mammals.</i>&mdash;Let us now
  pass to the other side of the great northern continent, and examine the
  list of the quadrupeds of Amoorland, in the same latitude as Germany. We
  find that there are forty-four terrestrial species (omitting the bats,
  the seals, and other marine animals), and of these no less than
  twenty-six are identical with European species, and twelve or thirteen
  more are closely allied representatives, leaving only five or six which
  are peculiarly Asiatic. We can hardly have a more convincing proof of the
  essential oneness of the mammalia of Europe and Northern Asia.</p>

  <p>In Northern Africa we do not find so many European species (though
  even here they are very numerous) because a considerable number of West
  Asiatic and desert forms occur. Having, however, shown that Europe and
  Western Asia have almost identical animals, we may treat all these as
  really European, and we shall then be able to compare the quadrupeds of
  North Africa with those of Europe and West Asia. Taking those of Algeria
  as the best known, we find that there are thirty-three species identical
  with those of Europe and West Asia, while twenty-four more, though
  distinct, are closely allied, belonging to the same genera; thus making a
  total of fifty-seven of European type. On the other hand, we have seven
  species which are either identical with species of tropical Africa or
  allied to them, and six more which are especially characteristic of the
  African and Asiatic deserts which form a kind of neutral zone between the
  temperate and tropical regions. If now we consider that Algeria and the
  adjacent countries bordering the Mediterranean form part of Africa, while
  they are separated from Europe by a wide sea and are only connected with
  Asia by a narrow isthmus, we cannot but feel surprised at the wonderful
  preponderance of the European and West Asiatic elements in the mammalia
  which inhabit the district.</p>

  <p><i>The Range of British Birds.</i>&mdash;As it is very important that
  no doubt should exist as to the limits of the zoological <!-- Page 35
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span>region of which
  Europe forms a part, we will now examine the birds, in order to see how
  far they agree in their distribution with the mammalia. Of late years
  great attention has been paid to the distribution of European and Asiatic
  birds, many ornithologists having travelled in North Africa, in
  Palestine, in Asia Minor, in Persia, in Siberia, in Mongolia, and in
  China; so that we are now able to determine the exact ranges of many
  species in a manner that would have been impossible a few years ago.
  These ranges are given for all British species in the new edition of
  Yarrell's <i>History of British Birds</i> edited by Professor Newton,
  while those of all European birds are given in still more detail in Mr.
  Dresser's beautiful work on the birds of Europe. In order to confine our
  examination within reasonable limits, and at the same time give it the
  interest attaching to familiar objects, we will take the whole series of
  British Passeres or perching birds given in Professor Newton's work (118
  in number) and arrange them in series according to the extent of their
  range. These include not only the permanent residents and regular
  migrants to our country, but also those which occasionally straggle here,
  so that it really comprises a large proportion of all European birds.</p>

  <p>We find, that out of a total of 118 British Passeres there are:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>32 species which range to North Africa and Central or East Asia.</p>

  <p>25 species which range to Central or East Asia, but not to North
  Africa.</p>

  <p>43 species which range to North Africa and Western Asia.</p>

  <p>6 species which range to North Africa, but not at all into Asia.</p>

  <p>7 species which range to West Asia, but not to North Africa.</p>

  <p>5 species which do not range out of Europe.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These figures agree essentially with those furnished by the mammalia,
  and complete the demonstration that all the temperate portions of Asia
  and North Africa must be added to Europe to form a natural zoological
  division of the earth. We must also note how comparatively few of these
  overpass the limits thus indicated; only seven species extending their
  range occasionally into tropical or South Africa, eight into some parts
  of tropical Asia, and six into arctic or temperate North America.</p>

  <p><i>Range of East Asian Birds.</i>&mdash;To complete the evidence we
  only require to know that the East Asiatic birds are as much like those
  of Europe, as we have already shown to be the case when we take the point
  of departure from our end of the continent. This does not follow
  necessarily, because it is possible that a totally distinct North Asiatic
  fauna might there prevail; and, although our birds go eastward to the
  remotest parts of Asia, their birds might not come westward to Europe.
  The birds of Eastern Siberia have been carefully studied by Russian
  naturalists and afford us the means of making the required comparison.
  There are 151 species belonging to the orders Passeres and Picariæ (the
  perching and climbing birds), and of these no less than 77, or more than
  half, are absolutely identical <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page39"></a>{39}</span>with European species; 63 are peculiar to
  North Asia, but all except five or six of these are allied to European
  forms; the remaining 11 species are migrants from South-eastern Asia. The
  resemblance is therefore equally close whichever extremity of the
  Euro-Asiatic continent we take as our starting point, and is equally
  remarkable in birds as in mammalia. We have now only to determine the
  limits of this, our first zoological region, which has been termed the
  "Palæarctic" by Mr. Sclater, meaning the "northern old-world"
  region&mdash;a name now well known to naturalists.</p>

  <p><i>The Limits of the Palæarctic Region.</i>&mdash;The boundaries of
  this region, as nearly as they can be ascertained, are shown on our
  general map at the beginning of this chapter, but it will be evident on
  consideration, that, except in a few places, its limits can only be
  approximately defined. On the north, east, and west it extends to the
  ocean, and includes a number of islands whose peculiarities will be
  pointed out in a subsequent chapter; so that the southern boundary alone
  remains, but as this runs across the entire continent from the Atlantic
  to the Pacific ocean, often traversing little-known regions, we may
  perhaps never be able to determine it accurately, even if it admits of
  such determination. In drawing the boundary line across Africa we meet
  with our first difficulty. The Euro-Asiatic animals undoubtedly extend to
  the northern borders of the Sahara, while those of tropical Africa come
  up to its southern margin, the desert itself forming a kind of sandy
  ocean between them. Some of the species on either side penetrate and even
  cross the desert, but it is impossible to balance these with any
  accuracy, and it has therefore been thought best, as a mere matter of
  convenience, to consider the geographical line of the tropic of Cancer to
  form the boundary. We are thus enabled to define the Palæarctic region as
  including all north temperate Africa; and, a similar intermingling of
  animal types occurring in Arabia, the same boundary line is continued to
  the southern shore of the Persian Gulf. Persia and Afghanistan
  undoubtedly belong to the Palæarctic region, and Baluchistan should
  probably go with these. The boundary in the north-western part of India
  is again difficult to determine, but it <!-- Page 40 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>{40}</span>cannot be far one way or
  the other from the river Indus as far up as Attock, opposite the mouth of
  the Cabool river. Here it will bend to the south-east, passing a little
  south of Cashmeer, and along the southern slopes of the Himalayas into
  East Thibet and China, at heights varying from 9,000 to 11,000 feet
  according to soil, aspect, and shelter. It may, perhaps, be defined as
  extending to the upper belt of forests as far as coniferous trees
  prevail; but the temperate and tropical faunas are here so intermingled
  that to draw any exact parting line is impossible. The two faunas are,
  however, very distinct. In and above the pine woods there are abundance
  of warblers of northern genera, with wrens, numerous titmice, and a great
  variety of buntings, grosbeaks, bullfinches and rosefinches, all more or
  less nearly allied to the birds of Europe and Northern Asia; while a
  little lower down we meet with a host of peculiar birds allied to those
  of tropical Asia and the Malay Islands, but often of distinct genera.
  There can be no doubt, therefore, of the existence here of a pretty sharp
  line of demarkation between the temperate and tropical faunas, though
  this line will be so irregular, owing to the complex system of valleys
  and ridges, that in our present ignorance of much of the country it
  cannot be marked in detail on any map.</p>

  <p>Further east in China it is still more difficult to determine the
  limits of the region, owing to the great intermixture of migrating birds;
  tropical forms passing northwards in summer as far as the Amoor river,
  while the northern forms visit every part of China in winter. From what
  we know, however, of the distribution of some of the more typical
  northern and southern species, we are able to fix the limits of the
  Palæarctic region a little south of Shanghai on the east coast. Several
  tropical genera come as far north as Ningpo or even Shanghai, but rarely
  beyond; while in Formosa and Amoy tropical forms predominate. Such
  decidedly northern forms as bullfinches and hawfinches are found at
  Shanghai; hence we may commence the boundary line on the coast between
  Shanghai and Ningpo, but inland it probably bends a little southward, and
  then northward to the mountains and valleys of West <!-- Page 41 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>{41}</span>China and East Thibet in
  about 32° N. latitude; where, at Moupin, a French missionary, Père David,
  made extensive collections showing this district to be at the junction of
  the tropical and temperate faunas. Japan, as a whole, is decidedly
  Palæarctic, although its extreme southern portion, owing to its mild
  insular climate and evergreen vegetation, gives shelter to a number of
  tropical forms.</p>

  <p><i>Characteristic Features of the Palæarctic Region.</i>&mdash;Having
  thus demonstrated the unity of the Palæarctic region by tracing out the
  distribution of a large proportion of its mammalia and birds, it only
  remains to show how far it is characterised by peculiar groups such as
  genera and families, and to say a few words on the lower forms of life
  which prevail in it.</p>

  <p>Taking first the mammalia, we find this region distinguished by
  possessing two peculiar genera of Talpidæ or moles, the family being
  confined to the Palæarctic and Nearctic regions. The true hedgehogs
  (Erinaceus) are also characteristic, being only found elsewhere in South
  Africa and in the northern part of the Oriental region. Among Carnivora,
  the racoon-dog (Nyctereutes) of North-eastern Asia, and the true badgers
  of the genus Meles are peculiar, most other parts of the world possessing
  distinct genera of badgers. It has six peculiar genera, or subgenera, of
  deer; seven peculiar genera of Bovidæ, chiefly antelopes; while the
  entire group of goats and sheep, comprising twenty-two species, is almost
  confined to it, one species only occurring in the Rocky mountains of
  North America and another in the Nilgiris of Southern India. Among the
  rodents there are nine genera with twenty-seven species wholly confined
  to it, while several others, as the hamsters, the dormice, and the pikas,
  have only a few species elsewhere.</p>

  <p>In birds there are a large number of peculiar genera of which we need
  mention only a few of the more important, as the grass-hopper warblers
  (Locustella) with seven species, the Accentors with twelve species, and
  about a dozen other genera of warblers, including the robins; the bearded
  titmouse and several allied genera; the long-tailed titmice forming the
  genus Acredula; the magpies, choughs, and nut-crackers; a host of
  finches, among which the bullfinches (Pyrrhula) and the buntings
  (Emberiza) are the <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page42"></a>{42}</span>most important. The true pheasants
  (Phasianus) are wholly Palæarctic, except one species in Formosa, as are
  several genera of wading birds. Though the reptiles of cold countries are
  few as compared with those of the tropics, the Palæarctic region in its
  warmer portions has a considerable number, and among these are many which
  are peculiar to it. Such are four genera of snakes, seven of lizards,
  five of frogs and toads, and twelve of newts and salamanders; while of
  fresh-water fishes there are about twenty peculiar genera.<a name="NtA_7"
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Among insects we may mention the elegant
  Apollo butterflies of the Alps as forming a peculiar genus (Parnassius),
  only found elsewhere in the Rocky Mountains of North America, while the
  beautiful genus Thais of the south of Europe and Sericinus of North China
  are equally remarkable. Among other insects we can only now refer to the
  great family of Carabidæ, or predaceous ground-beetles, which are
  immensely numerous in this region, there being about fifty peculiar
  genera; while the large and handsome genus Carabus, with its allies
  Procerus and Procrustes, containing nearly 300 species, is almost wholly
  confined to this region, and would alone serve to distinguish it
  zoologically from all other parts of the globe.</p>

<p><!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span></p>

  <p>Having given so full an exposition of the facts which determine the
  extent and boundaries of the Palæarctic region, there is less need of
  entering into much detail as regards the other regions of the Eastern
  Hemisphere; their boundaries being easily defined, while their forms of
  animal life are well marked and strongly contrasted.</p>

  <p><i>Definition and Characteristic Groups of the Ethiopian
  Region.</i>&mdash;The Ethiopian region consists of all tropical and south
  Africa, to which are appended the large island of Madagascar and the
  Mascarene Islands to the east and north of it, though these differ
  materially from the continent, and will have to be discussed in a
  separate chapter. For the present, then, we will take Africa south of the
  tropic of Cancer, and consider how far its animals are distinct from
  those of the Palæarctic region.</p>

  <p>Taking first the mammalia, we find the following remarkable animals at
  once separating it from the Palæarctic and every other region. The
  gorilla and chimpanzee, the baboons, numerous lemurs, the spotted hyæna,
  the aard-wolf and hyæna-dog, zebras, the hippopotamus, giraffe, and more
  than seventy peculiar antelopes. Here we have a wonderful collection of
  large and peculiar quadrupeds, but the Ethiopian region is also
  characterised by the absence of others which are not only abundant in the
  Palæarctic region but in many tropical regions as well. The most
  remarkable of these deficiencies are the bears the deer and the wild
  oxen, all of which abound in the tropical parts of Asia while bears and
  deer extend into both North and South America. Besides the large and
  conspicuous animals mentioned above, Africa possesses a number of
  completely isolated groups; such are the potamogale, a curious otter-like
  water-shrew, discovered by Du Chaillu in West Africa, so distinct as to
  constitute a new family, Potamogalidæ; the goldenmoles, also forming a
  peculiar family, Chrysochloridæ; as do the elephant-shrews,
  Macroscelididæ; the singular aard-varks, or earth-pigs, forming a
  peculiar family of Edentata called Orycteropodidæ; while there are
  numerous peculiar genera of monkeys, swine, civets, and rodents.</p>

  <p>Among birds the most conspicuous and remarkable are, the great-billed
  vulture-crows (Corvultur), the long-tailed <!-- Page 44 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>{44}</span>whydah finches (Vidua),
  the curious ox-peckers (Buphaga), the splendid metallic starlings
  (Lamprocolius), the handsome plantain-eaters (Musophaga), the
  ground-hornbills (Bucorvus), the numerous guinea-fowls belonging to four
  distinct genera, the serpent-eating secretary-bird (Serpentarius), the
  huge boat-billed heron (Balæniceps), and the true ostriches. There are
  also three quite peculiar African families, the Musophagidæ or
  plantain-eaters, including the elegant crested touracos; the curious
  little finch-like colies (Coliidæ), and the Irrisoridæ, insect-eating
  birds allied to the hoopoes but with glossy metallic plumage and arboreal
  habits.</p>

  <p>In reptiles, fishes, insects, and land-shells, Africa is very rich,
  and possesses an immense number of peculiar forms. These are not
  sufficiently familiar to require notice in a work of this character, but
  we may mention a few as mere illustrations: the puff-adders, the most
  hideous of poisonous snakes; the chameleons, the most remarkable of
  lizards; the goliath-beetles, the largest and handsomest of the
  Cetoniidæ; and some of the Achatinæ, which are the largest of all known
  land-shells.</p>

  <p><i>Definition and Characteristic Groups of the Oriental
  Region.</i>&mdash;The Oriental region comprises all Asia south of the
  Palæarctic limits, and along with this the Malay Islands as far as the
  Philippines, Borneo, and Java. It was called the Indian region by Mr.
  Sclater, but this term has been objected to because the Indo-Chinese and
  Malayan districts are the richest and most characteristic, while the
  peninsula of India is the poorest portion of it. The name "Oriental" has
  therefore been adopted in my work on <i>The Geographical Distribution of
  Animals</i> as preferable to either Malayan or Indo-Australian, both of
  which have been proposed, but are objectionable, as being already in use
  in a different sense.</p>

  <p>The great features of the mammals of the Oriental region are, the
  long-armed apes, the orang-utans, the tiger, the sun-bears and
  honey-bears, the tapir, the chevrotains or mouse-deer, and the Indian
  elephant. Its most conspicuous birds are the immense number and variety
  of babbling-thrushes (Timaliidæ), its beautiful little hill-tits
  (Liotrichidæ), its green bulbuls (Phyllornithidæ), its many varieties
  <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>{45}</span>of
  the crow-family, its beautiful gapers and pittas adorned with the most
  delicate colours, its great variety of hornbills, and its magnificent
  Phasianidæ, comprising the peacocks, argus-pheasants, fire-backed
  pheasants, and jungle-fowl. Many of these are, it is true, absent from
  the peninsula of Hindostan, but sufficient remain there to ally it with
  the other parts of the region.</p>

  <p>Among the remarkable but less conspicuous forms of mammalia which are
  peculiar to this region are, monkeys of the genus Presbyter, extending to
  every part of it; lemurs of three peculiar genera&mdash;Nycticebus and
  Loris (slow lemurs) and Tarsius (spectre lemurs); the flying lemur
  (Galeopithecus), now classed as a peculiar family of Insectivora and
  found only in the Malay Islands; the family of the Tupaias, or
  squirrel-shrews, curious little arboreal Insectivora somewhat resembling
  squirrels; no less than twelve peculiar genera of the civet family, three
  peculiar antelopes, five species of rhinoceros, and the round-tailed
  flying squirrels forming the genus Pteromys.</p>

  <p>Of the peculiar groups of birds we can only mention a few. The curious
  little tailor-birds of the genus Orthotomus are found over the whole
  region and almost alone serve to characterise it, as do the fine
  laughing-thrushes, forming the genus Garrulax; while the beautiful
  grass-green fruit-thrushes (Phyllornis), and the brilliant little
  minivets (Pericrocotus), are almost equally universal. Woodpeckers are
  abundant, belonging to a dozen peculiar genera; while gaudy barbets and
  strange forms of cuckoos and hornbills are also to be met with
  everywhere. Among game birds, the only genus that is universally
  distributed, and which may be said to characterise the region, is Gallus,
  comprising the true jungle-fowl, one of which, Gallus bankiva, is found
  from the Himalayas and Central India to Malacca, Java, and even eastward
  to Timor, and is the undoubted origin of almost all our domestic poultry.
  Southern India and Ceylon each possesses distinct species of jungle-fowl,
  and a third very handsome green bird (Gallus æneus inhabits Java.)</p>

  <p>Reptiles are as abundant as in Africa, but they present no well-known
  groups which can be considered as specially characteristic. Among insects
  we may notice the <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>{46}</span>magnificent golden and green Papilionidæ of
  various genera as being unequalled in the world; while the great Atlas
  moth is probably the most gigantic of Lepidoptera, being sometimes ten
  inches across the wings, which are also very broad. Among the beetles the
  strange flat-bodied Malayan mormolyce is the largest of all the Carabidæ,
  while the catoxantha is equally a giant among the Buprestidæ. On the
  whole, the insects of this region probably surpass those of any other
  part of the world, except South America, in size, variety, and
  beauty.</p>

  <p><i>Definition and Characteristic Groups of the Australian
  Region.</i>&mdash;The Australian region is so well marked off from the
  Oriental, as well as from all other parts of the world, by zoological
  peculiarities, that we need not take up much time in describing it,
  especially as some of its component islands will come under review at a
  subsequent stage of our work. Its most important portions are Australia
  and New Guinea, but it also includes all the Malayan and Pacific Islands
  to the east of Borneo, Java, and Bali, the Oriental region terminating
  with the submarine bank on which those islands are situated. The island
  of Celebes is included in this region from a balance of considerations,
  but it almost equally well belongs to the Oriental, and must be left out
  of the account in our general sketch of the zoological features of the
  Australian region.</p>

  <p>The great feature of the Australian region is the almost total absence
  of all the forms of terrestrial mammalia which abound in the rest of the
  world, their place being supplied by a great variety of Marsupials. In
  Australia and New Guinea there are no Insectivora, Carnivora, nor
  Ungulata, while even the rodents are only represented by a few small rats
  and mice. In the remoter Pacific Islands mammals are altogether absent
  (except perhaps in New Zealand), but in the Moluccas and other islands
  bordering on the Oriental region the higher mammals are represented by a
  few deer, civets, and pigs, though it is doubtful whether the two former
  may not have been introduced by man, as was almost certainly the case
  with the semi-domesticated dingo of Australia.<a name="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> These peculiarities in the mammalia <!--
  Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span>are so
  great that every naturalist agrees that Australia must be made a separate
  region, the only difference of opinion being as to its extent, some
  thinking that New Zealand should form another separate region; but this
  question need not now delay us.</p>

  <p>In birds Australia is by no means so isolated from the rest of the
  world, as it contains great numbers of warblers, thrushes, flycatchers,
  shrikes, crows, and other familiar types of the Eastern Hemisphere; yet a
  considerable number of the most characteristic Oriental families are
  absent. Thus there are no vultures, woodpeckers, pheasants, bulbuls, or
  barbets in the Australian region; and the absence of these is almost as
  marked a feature as that of cats, deer, or monkeys, among mammalia. The
  most conspicuous and characteristic birds of the Australian region are,
  the piping crows; the honey-suckers (Meliphagidæ), a family quite
  peculiar to the region; the lyre-birds; the great terrestrial kingfishers
  (Dacelo); the great goat-suckers called more-porks in Australia and
  forming the genus Podargus; the wonderful abundance of parrots, including
  such remarkable forms as the white and black cockatoos, and the
  gorgeously coloured brush-tongued lories; the almost equal abundance of
  fine pigeons more gaily coloured than any others on the globe; the
  strange brush-turkeys and mound-builders, the only birds that <!-- Page
  48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>{48}</span>never sit
  upon their eggs, but allow them to be hatched, reptile-like, by the heat
  of the sand or of fermenting vegetable matter; and lastly, the emus and
  cassowaries, in which the wings are far more rudimentary than in the
  ostriches of Africa and South America. New Guinea and the surrounding
  islands are remarkable for their tree-kangaroos, their birds-of-paradise,
  their raquet-tailed kingfishers, their great crown-pigeons, their crimson
  lories, and many other remarkable birds. This brief outline being
  sufficient to show the distinctness and isolation of the Australian
  region, we will now pass to the consideration of the Western
  Hemisphere.</p>

  <p><i>Definition and Characteristic Groups of the Nearctic
  Region.</i>&mdash;The Nearctic region comprises all temperate and arctic
  North America, including Greenland, the only doubt being as to its
  southern boundary, many northern types penetrating into the tropical zone
  by means of the highlands and volcanic peaks of Mexico and Guatemala,
  while a few which are characteristic of the tropics extend northward into
  Texas and California. There is, however, considerable evidence showing
  that on the east coast the Rio Grande del Norte, and on the west a point
  nearly opposite Cape St. Lucas, form the most natural boundary; but
  instead of being drawn straight across, the line bends to the south-east
  as soon as it rises on the flanks of the table-land, forming a deep loop
  which extends some distance beyond the city of Mexico, and perhaps ought
  to be continued along the higher ridges of Guatemala.</p>

  <p>The Nearctic region is so similar to the Palæarctic in position and
  climate, and the two so closely approach each other at Behring Straits,
  that we cannot wonder at there being a certain amount of similarity
  between them&mdash;a similarity which some naturalists have so far
  over-estimated as to think that the two regions ought to be united. Let
  us therefore carefully examine the special zoological features of this
  region, and see how far it resembles, and how far differs from, the
  Palæarctic.</p>

  <p>At first sight the mammalia of North America do not seem to differ
  much from those of Europe or Northern Asia. There are cats, lynxes,
  wolves and foxes, weasels, bears, elk and deer, voles, beavers,
  squirrels, marmots, and <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>{49}</span>hares, all very similar to those of the
  Eastern Hemisphere, and several hardly distinguishable. Even the bison or
  "buffalo" of the prairies, once so abundant and characteristic, is a
  close ally of the now almost extinct "aurochs" of Lithuania. Here, then,
  we undoubtedly find a very close resemblance between the two regions, and
  if this were all, we should have great difficulty in separating them. But
  along with these, we find another set of mammals, not quite so
  conspicuous but nevertheless very important. We have first, three
  peculiar genera of moles, one of which, the star-nosed mole, is a most
  extraordinary creature, quite unlike anything else. Then there are three
  genera of the weasel family, including the well-known skunk (Mephitis),
  all quite different from Eastern forms. Then we come to a peculiar family
  of carnivora, the racoons, very distinct from anything in Europe or Asia;
  and in the Rocky Mountains we find the prong-horn antelope (Antilocapra)
  and the mountain goat of the trappers (Aplocerus), both peculiar genera.
  Coming to the rodents we find that the mice of America differ in some
  dental peculiarities from those of the rest of the world, and thus form
  several distinct genera; the jumping mouse (Xapus) is a peculiar form of
  the jerboa family, and then we come to the pouched rats (Geomyidæ), a
  very curious family consisting of four genera and nineteen species,
  peculiar to North America, though not confined to the Nearctic region.
  The prairie dogs (Cynomys), the tree porcupine (Erethizon), the curious
  sewellel (Haploodon), and the opossum (Didelphys) complete the list of
  peculiar mammalia which distinguish the northern region of the new world
  from that of the old. We must add to these peculiarities some remarkable
  deficiencies. The Nearctic region has no hedgehogs, nor wild pigs, nor
  dormice, and only one wild sheep in the Rocky Mountains as against twenty
  species of sheep and goats in the Palæarctic region.</p>

  <p>In birds also the similarities to our own familiar songsters first
  strike us, though the differences are perhaps really greater than in the
  quadrupeds. We see thrushes and wrens, tits and finches, and what seem to
  be warblers and flycatchers and starlings in abundance; but a closer
  examination shows the ornithologist that what he took for the <!-- Page
  50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span>latter are
  really quite distinct, and that there is not a single true flycatcher of
  the family Muscicapidæ, or a single starling of the family Sturnidæ in
  the whole continent, while there are very few true warblers (Sylviidæ),
  their place being taken by the quite distinct families Mniotiltidæ or
  wood-warblers, and Vireonidæ or greenlets. In like manner the flycatchers
  of America belong to the totally distinct family of tyrant-birds,
  Tyrannidæ, and those that look like starlings to the hang-nests,
  Icteridæ; and these four peculiar families comprise about a hundred and
  twenty species, and give a special character to the ornithology of the
  country. Add to these such peculiar birds as the mocking thrushes
  (Mimus), the blue jays (Cyanocitta), the tanagers, the peculiar genera of
  cuckoos (Coccygus and Crotophaga), the humming-birds, the wild turkeys
  (Meleagris), and the turkey-buzzards (Cathartes), and we see that if
  there is any doubt as to the mammals of North America being sufficiently
  distinct to justify the creation of a separate region, the evidence of
  the birds would alone settle the question.</p>

  <p>The reptiles, and some others of the lower <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `animials'.">animals</span>, add still more to this
  weight of evidence. The true rattlesnakes are highly characteristic, and
  among the lizards are several genera of the peculiar American family, the
  Iguanidæ. Nowhere in the world are the tailed batrachians so largely
  developed as in this region, the Sirens and the Amphiumidæ forming two
  peculiar families, while there are nine peculiar genera of salamanders,
  and two others allied respectively to the Proteus of Europe and the
  Sieboldia or giant salamander of Japan. There are seven peculiar families
  and about thirty peculiar genera of fresh-water fishes; while the
  fresh-water molluscs are more numerous than in any other region, more
  than thirteen hundred species and varieties having been described.</p>

  <p>Combining the evidence derived from all these classes of animals, we
  find the Nearctic region to be exceedingly well characterised, and to be
  amply distinct from the Palæarctic. The few species that are common to
  the two are almost all arctic, or, at least, northern types, and may be
  compared with those desert forms which occupy the debatable ground
  between the Palæarctic, Ethiopian, and Oriental regions. <!-- Page 51
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span>If, however, we
  compare the number of species, which are common to the Nearctic and
  Palæarctic regions with the number common to the western and eastern
  extremities of the latter region, we shall find a wonderful difference
  between the two cases; and if we further call to mind the number of
  important groups characteristic of the one region but absent from the
  other, we shall be obliged to admit that the relation that undoubtedly
  exists between the faunas of North America and Europe is of a very
  distinct nature from that which connects together Western Europe and
  North-eastern Asia in the bonds of zoological unity.</p>

  <p><i>Definition and Characteristic Groups of the Neotropical
  Region.</i>&mdash;The Neotropical region requires very little definition,
  since it comprises the whole of America south of the Nearctic region,
  with the addition of the Antilles or West Indian Islands. Its zoological
  peculiarities are almost as marked as those of Australia, which, however,
  it far exceeds in the extreme richness and variety of all its forms of
  life. To show how distinct it is from all the other regions of the globe,
  we need only enumerate some of the best known and more conspicuous of the
  animal forms which are peculiar to it. Such are, among mammalia&mdash;the
  prehensile-tailed monkeys and the marmosets, the blood-sucking bats, the
  coati-mundis, the peccaries, the llamas and alpacas, the chinchillas, the
  agoutis, the sloths, the armadillos, and the ant-eaters; a series of
  types more varied, and more distinct from those of the rest of the world
  than any other continent can boast of. Among birds we have the charming
  sugar-birds, forming the family C&oelig;rebidæ; the immense and
  wonderfully varied group of tanagers; the exquisite little manakins, and
  the gorgeously-coloured chatterers; the host of tree-creepers of the
  family Dendrocolaptidæ; the wonderful toucans; the puff-birds, jacamars,
  todies and motmots; the marvellous assemblage of four hundred distinct
  kinds of humming-birds; the gorgeous macaws; the curassows, the
  trumpeters, and the sun-bitterns. Here again there is no other continent
  or region that can produce such an assemblage of remarkable and perfectly
  distinct groups of birds; and no less wonderful is its richness in
  species, since these fully equal, if they do not surpass, those of the
  <!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>two
  great tropical regions of the Eastern Hemisphere (the Ethiopian and the
  Oriental) combined.</p>

  <p>As an additional indication of the distinctness and isolation of the
  Neotropical region from all others, and especially from the whole Eastern
  Hemisphere, we must say something of the otherwise widely distributed
  groups which are absent. Among mammalia we have first the order
  Insectivora, entirely absent from South America, though a few species are
  found in Central America and the West Indies; the Viverridæ or civet
  family is wholly wanting, as are every form of sheep, oxen, or antelopes;
  while the swine, the elephants, and the rhinoceroses of the old world are
  represented by the diminutive peccaries and tapirs.</p>

  <p>Among birds we have to notice the absence of tits, true flycatchers,
  shrikes, sunbirds, starlings, larks (except a solitary species in the
  Andes), rollers, bee-eaters, and pheasants, while warblers are very
  scarce, and the almost cosmopolitan wagtails are represented by a single
  species of pipit.</p>

  <p>We must also notice the preponderance of low or archaic types among
  the animals of South America. Edentates, marsupials, and rodents form the
  majority of the terrestrial mammalia; while such higher groups as the
  carnivora and hoofed animals are exceedingly deficient. Among birds a low
  type of Passeres, characterised by the absence of the singing muscles, is
  excessively prevalent, the enormous groups of the ant-thrushes, tyrants,
  tree-creepers, manakins, and chatterers belonging to it. The Picariæ (a
  lower group) also prevail to a far greater extent than in any other
  regions, both in variety of forms and number of species; and the chief
  representatives of the gallinaceous birds&mdash;the curassows and
  tinamous, are believed to be allied, the former to the brush-turkeys of
  Australia, the latter (very remotely) to the ostriches, two of the least
  developed types of birds.</p>

  <p>Whether, therefore, we consider its richness in peculiar forms of
  animal life, its enormous variety of species, its numerous deficiencies
  as compared with other parts of the world, or the prevalence of a low
  type of organisation among its higher animals, the Neotropical region
  stands out as undoubtedly the most remarkable of the great zoological
  divisions of the earth.</p>

  <p>In reptiles, amphibia, fresh-water fishes, and insects, <!-- Page 53
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>{53}</span>this region is
  equally peculiar, but we need not refer to these here, our only object
  now being to establish by a sufficient number of well-known and easily
  remembered examples, the distinctness of each region from all others, and
  its unity as a whole. The former has now been sufficiently demonstrated,
  but it may be well to say a few words as to the latter point.</p>

  <p>The only outlying portions of the region about which there can be any
  doubt are&mdash;Central America, or that part of the region north of the
  Isthmus of Panama, the Antilles or West Indian Islands, and the temperate
  portion of South America including Chili and Patagonia.</p>

  <p>In Central America, and especially in Mexico, we have an intermixture
  of South American and North American animals, but the former undoubtedly
  predominate, and a large proportion of the peculiar Neotropical groups
  extend as far as Costa Rica. Even in Guatemala and Mexico we have howling
  and spider-monkeys, coati-mundis, tapirs, and armadillos; while
  chatterers, manakins, ant-thrushes, and other peculiarly Neotropical
  groups of birds are abundant. There is therefore no doubt as to Mexico
  forming part of this region, although it is comparatively poor, and
  exhibits the intermingling of temperate and tropical forms.</p>

  <p>The West Indies are less clearly Neotropical, their poverty in mammals
  as well as in most other groups being extreme, while great numbers of
  North American birds migrate there in winter. The resident birds,
  however, comprise trogons, sugar-birds, chatterers, with many
  humming-birds and parrots, representing eighteen peculiar Neotropical
  genera; a fact which decides the region to which the islands belong.</p>

  <p>South temperate America is also very poor as compared with the
  tropical parts of the region, and its insects contain a considerable
  proportion of north temperate forms. But it contains armadillos, cavies
  and opossums; and its birds all belong to American groups, though, owing
  to the inferior climate and deficiency of forests, a number of the
  families of birds peculiar to tropical America are wanting. Thus there
  are no manakins, chatterers, toucans, trogons, or motmots; but there are
  abundance of hang-nests, tyrant-birds, ant-thrushes, tree-creepers, and a
  fair <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>{54}</span>proportion of humming-birds, tanagers and
  parrots. The zoology is therefore thoroughly Neotropical, although
  somewhat poor; and it has a number of peculiar forms of strictly
  Neotropical types&mdash;as the chinchillas, alpacas, &amp;c., which are
  not found in the tropical regions except in the high Andes.</p>

  <p><i>Comparison of Zoological Regions with the Geographical Divisions of
  the Globe.</i>&mdash;Having now completed our survey of the great
  zoological regions of the globe, we find that they do not differ so much
  from the old geographical divisions as our first example might have led
  us to suppose. Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, North America, and South
  America, really correspond, each to a zoological region, but their
  boundaries require to be modified more or less considerably; and if we
  remember this, and keep their extensions or limitations always in our
  mind, we may use the terms "South American" or "North American," as being
  equivalent to Neotropical and Nearctic, without much inconvenience, while
  "African" and "Australian" equally well serve to express the zoological
  type of the Ethiopian and Australian regions. Europe and Asia require
  more important modifications. The European fauna does indeed well
  represent the Palæarctic in all its main features, and if instead of Asia
  we say tropical Asia we have the Oriental region very fairly defined; so
  that the relation of the geographical with the zoological primary
  divisions of the earth is sufficiently clear. In order to make these
  relations visible to the eye and more easily remembered, we will put them
  into a tabular form:</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the preceding chapters we have explained the general nature of the
  phenomena presented by the distribution of animals, and have illustrated
  and defined the new geographical division of the earth which is found
  best to agree with them. Before we go further into the details of our
  subject, and especially before we attempt to trace the causes which have
  brought about the existing biological relations of the islands of the
  globe, it is absolutely necessary to have a clear comprehension of the
  collateral facts and general principles to which we shall most frequently
  have occasion to refer. These may be briefly defined as, the powers of
  dispersal of animals and plants under different conditions, such as
  geological and climatal changes, and the origin and development of
  species and groups by natural selection. This last is of the most
  fundamental importance, and its bearing on the dispersal <!-- Page 56
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>{56}</span>of animals has
  been much neglected. We therefore devote the present chapter to its
  consideration.</p>

  <p>As we have already shown in our first chapter that the distribution of
  species, of genera, and of families, present almost exactly the same
  general phenomena in varying degrees of complexity, and that almost all
  the interesting problems we have to deal with depend upon the mode of
  dispersal of one or other of these; and as, further, our knowledge of
  most of these groups, in the higher animals at least, is confined to the
  tertiary period of geology, it is therefore unnecessary for us to enter
  into any questions involving the origin of more comprehensive groups,
  such as classes or orders. This enables us to avoid most of the disputed
  questions as to the development of animals, and to confine ourselves to
  those general principles regulating the origin and development of species
  and genera which were first laid down by Mr. Darwin thirty years ago, and
  have now come to be adopted by naturalists as established propositions in
  the theory of evolution.</p>

  <p><i>The Origin of New Species.</i>&mdash;How, then, do new species
  arise, supposing the world to have been, physically, much as we now see
  it; and what becomes of them after they have arisen? In the first place
  we must remember that new species can only be formed when and where there
  is room for them. If a continent is fully stocked with animals, each
  species being so well adapted for its mode of life that it can overcome
  all the dangers to which it is exposed, and maintain on the average a
  tolerably uniform population, then, so long as no change takes place, no
  new species will arise. For every place or station is supposed to be
  filled by creatures in all respects adapted to surrounding conditions,
  able to defend themselves from all enemies, and to obtain food
  notwithstanding the rivalry of many competitors. But such a perfect
  balance of organisms nowhere exists upon the earth, and probably never
  has existed. The well-known fact that some species are very common, while
  others are very rare, is an almost certain proof that the one is better
  adapted to its position than the other; and this belief is strengthened
  when we find the individuals of one species ranging into different <!--
  Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page57"></a>{57}</span>climates, subsisting on different food, and
  competing with different sets of animals, while the individuals of
  another species will be limited to a small area beyond which they seem
  unable to extend. When a change occurs, either of climate or geography,
  some of the small and ill-adapted species will probably die out
  altogether, and thus leave room for others to increase, or for new forms
  to occupy their places.</p>

  <p>But the change will most likely affect even flourishing species in
  different ways, some beneficially, others injuriously. Or, again, it may
  affect a great many injuriously, to such an extent as to require some
  change in their structure or habits to enable them to get on as well as
  before. Now "variation" and the "struggle for existence" come into play.
  All the weaker and less perfectly organised individuals die out, while
  those which vary in such a way as to bring them into more harmony with
  the new conditions constantly survive. If the change of conditions has
  been considerable, then, after a few centuries, or perhaps even a few
  generations, one or more <i>new species</i> will be almost sure to be
  formed.</p>

  <p><i>Variation in Animals.</i>&mdash;To make this more intelligible to
  those who have not considered the subject, and to obviate the difficulty
  many feel about "favourable variations occurring at the right time," it
  will be well to discuss this matter a little more fully. Few persons
  consider how largely and universally all animals are varying. We know,
  however, that in every generation, if we could examine all the
  individuals of any common species, we should find considerable
  differences, not only in size and colour, but in the form and proportions
  of all the parts and organs of the body. In our domesticated animals we
  know this to be the case, and it is by means of the continual selection
  of such slight varieties to breed from that all our extremely different
  domestic breeds have been produced. Think of the difference in every
  limb, and every bone and muscle, and probably in every part, internal and
  external of the whole body, between a greyhound and a bull-dog! Yet, if
  we had the complete series of ancestors of these two breeds before us, we
  should <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page58"></a>{58}</span>probably find that in no one generation was
  there a greater difference than now occurs in the same breed, or
  sometimes even the same litter. It is often thought, however, that wild
  species do not vary sufficiently to bring about any such change as this
  in the same time; and though naturalists are well aware that this is a
  mistake, it is only recently that they have been able to adduce positive
  proof of their opinion.</p>

  <p><i>The Amount of Variation in North American Birds.</i>&mdash;An
  American naturalist, Mr. J.&nbsp;A. Allen, has made elaborate observations and
  measurements of the birds of the United States, and he finds a wonderful
  and altogether unsuspected amount of variation between individuals of the
  same species. They differ in the general tint, and in the markings and
  distribution of the colours; in size and proportions; in the length of
  the wings, tail, bill, and feet; in the length of particular feathers,
  altering the shape of the wing or tail; in the length of the tarsi and of
  the separate toes, and in the length, width, thickness, and curvature of
  the bill. These variations are very considerable, often reaching to
  one-sixth or one-seventh of the average dimensions, and sometimes more.
  Thus <i>Turdus fuscescens</i> (Wilson's thrush) varied in length of wing
  from 3.58 to 4.16 inches, and in the tail from 3.55 to 4.00 inches; and
  in twelve specimens, all taken in the same locality, the wing varied in
  length from 14.5 to 21 per cent., and the tail from 14 to 22.5 per cent.
  In <i>Sialia sialis</i> (the blue bird) the middle toe varied from .77 to
  .91 inch, and the hind toe from .58 to .72 inch, or more than 21.5 per
  cent. on the mean, while the bill varied from .45 to .56 inch in length,
  and from .30 to .38 inch in width, or about 20 per cent. in both cases.
  In <i>Dendr&oelig;ca coronata</i> (the yellow-crowned warbler) the quills
  vary in proportionate length, so that the 1st, the 2nd, the 3rd, or the
  4th, is sometimes longest; and a similar variation of the wing involving
  a change of proportion between two or more of the feathers is recorded in
  eleven species of birds. Colour and marking vary to an equal extent; the
  dark streaks on the under surface of <i>Melospiza melodia</i> (the
  American song-sparrow) being sometimes reduced to narrow lines. <!-- Page
  59 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>{59}</span>while in
  other specimens they are so enlarged as to cover the greater part of the
  breast and sides of the body, sometimes uniting on the middle of the
  breast into a nearly continuous patch. In one of the small spotted
  wood-thrushes, <i>Turdus fuscescens</i>, the colours are sometimes very
  pale, and the markings on the breast reduced to indistinct narrow lines,
  while in other specimens the general colour is much darker, and the
  breast markings dark, broad, and triangular. All the variations here
  mentioned occur between adult males, so that there is no question of
  differences of age or sex, and the pair last referred to were taken at
  the same place and on the same day.<a name="NtA_9"
  href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <p>These interesting facts entirely support the belief in the variability
  of all animals in all their parts and organs, to an extent amply
  sufficient for natural selection to work with. We may, indeed, admit that
  these are extreme cases, and that the majority of species do not vary
  half or a quarter so much as shown in the examples quoted, and we shall
  still have ample variation for all purposes of specific modification.
  Instead of an extreme variation in the dimensions and proportions of the
  various organs of from 10 to 25 per cent. as is here proved to occur, we
  may assume from 3 to 6 per cent. as generally occurring in the majority
  of species; and if we further remember that the above excessive
  variations were found by comparing a number of specimens of each species,
  varying from 50 to 150 only, we may be sure that the smaller variations
  we require must occur in considerable numbers among the thousands or
  millions of individuals of which all but the very rare species consist.
  If, therefore, we were to divide the population of any species into three
  groups of equal extent, with regard to any particular character&mdash;as
  length of wing, or of toes, or thickness or curvature of bill, or
  strength of markings&mdash;we should have one group in which the mean or
  average character prevailed with little variation, one in which the
  character was greatly, and one in which it was little, <!-- Page 60
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span>developed. If we
  formed our groups, not by equal numbers, but by equal amount of
  variation, we should probably find, in accordance with the law of
  averages, that the central group in which the mean characteristics
  prevailed was much more numerous than the extremes, perhaps twice, or
  even three times, as great as either of them, and forming such a series
  as the following&mdash;10 maximum, 30 mean, 10 minimum development. In
  ordinary cases we have no reason to believe that the mean characters or
  the amount of variation of a species changes materially from year to year
  or from century to century, and we may therefore look upon the central
  group as the type of the species which is best adapted to the conditions
  in which it has actually to exist. This type will therefore always form
  the majority, because the struggle for existence will lead to the
  continual suppression of the less perfectly adapted extremes. But
  sometimes a species has a wide range into countries which differ in
  physical conditions, and then it often happens that one or other of the
  extremes will predominate in a portion of its range. These form local
  varieties, but as they occur mixed with the other forms, they are not
  considered to be distinct species, although they may differ from the
  other extreme form quite as much as species often do from each other.<a
  name="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>How New Species arise from a Variable Species.</i>&mdash;It is now
  very easy to understand how, from such a variable species, one or more
  new species may arise. The peculiar physical or organic conditions that
  render one part of the area better adapted to an extreme form may become
  intensified, and the most extreme variations thus having the advantage,
  they will multiply at the expense of the rest. If the change of
  conditions spreads over the whole area occupied by the species, this one
  extreme form will replace the others; while if the area should be cut in
  two by subsidence or elevation, the conditions of the two parts may be
  modified in opposite directions, so as to be each adapted to one extreme
  form; in which case the original type will become extinct, being replaced
  by two species, <!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page61"></a>{61}</span>each formed by a combination of certain
  extreme characters which had before existed in some of its varieties.</p>

  <p>The changes of conditions which lead to such selection of varieties
  are very diverse in nature, and new species may thus be formed, diverging
  in many ways from the original stock. The climate may change from moist
  to dry, or the reverse, or the temperature may increase or diminish for
  long periods, in either case requiring a corresponding change of
  constitution, of covering, of vegetable or of insect food, to be met by
  the selection of variations of colour or of swiftness, of length of bill
  or of strength of claws. Again, competitors or enemies may arrive from
  other regions, giving the advantage to such varieties as can change their
  food, or by swifter flight or greater wariness can escape their new foes.
  We may thus easily understand how a series of changes may occur at
  distant intervals, each leading to the selection and preservation of a
  special set of variations, and thus what was a single species may become
  transformed into a group of allied species differing from each other in a
  variety of ways, just as we find them in nature.</p>

  <p>Among these species, however, there will be some which will have
  become adapted to very local or special conditions, and will therefore be
  comparatively few in number and confined to a limited area; while others,
  retaining the more general characters of the parent form, but with some
  important change of structure, will be better adapted to succeed in the
  struggle for existence with other animals, will spread over a wider area,
  and increase so as to become common species. Sometimes these will acquire
  such a perfection of organisation by successive favourable modifications
  that they will be able to spread greatly beyond the range of the parent
  form. They then become what are termed dominant species, maintaining
  themselves in vigour and abundance over very wide areas, displacing other
  species with which they come into competition, and, under still further
  changes of conditions, becoming the parents of a new set of diverging
  species.</p>

  <p><i>Definition and Origin of Genera.</i>&mdash;As some of the most
  important and interesting phenomena of distribution relate <!-- Page 62
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>{62}</span>to genera rather
  than to single species, it will be well here to explain what is meant by
  a genus, and how genera are supposed to arise.</p>

  <p>A genus is a group of allied species which differs from all other
  groups in some well marked characters, usually of a structural rather
  than a superficial nature. Species of one genus usually differ from each
  other in size, in colour or marking, in the proportions of the limbs or
  other organs, and in the form and size of such superficial appendages as
  horns, crests, manes, &amp;c.; but they generally agree in the form and
  structure of important organs, as the teeth, the bill, the feet, and the
  wings. When two groups of species differ from each other constantly in
  one or more of these latter particulars they are said to belong to
  different genera. We have already seen that species vary in these more
  important as well as in the more superficial characters. If, then, in any
  part of the area occupied by a species some change of habits becomes
  useful to it, all such structural variations as facilitate the change
  will be accumulated by natural selection, and when they have become fixed
  in the proportions most beneficial to the animal, we shall have the first
  species of a new genus.</p>

  <p>A creature which has been thus modified in important characters will
  be a new type, specially adapted to fill a new place in the economy of
  nature. It will almost certainly have arisen from an extensive or
  dominant species, because only such are sufficiently rich in individuals
  to afford an ample supply of the necessary variations, and it will
  inherit the vigour of constitution and adaptability to a wide range of
  conditions which gave success to its ancestors. It will therefore have
  every chance in its favour in the struggle for existence; it may spread
  widely and displace many of its nearest allies, and in doing so will
  itself become modified superficially and become the parent of a number of
  subordinate species. It will now have become a dominant <i>genus</i>,
  occupying an entire continent, or perhaps even two or more continents,
  spreading in every direction till it comes in contact with competing
  forms better adapted to the different environments. Such a genus may
  continue to exist during long geological <!-- Page 63 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>{63}</span>epochs; but the time will
  generally come when either physical changes, or competing forms, or new
  enemies are too much for it, and it begins to lose its supremacy. First
  one then another of its component species will dwindle away and become
  extinct, till at last only a few species remain. Sometimes these soon
  follow the others and the whole genus dies out, as thousands of genera
  have died out during the long course of the earth's life-history; but it
  will also sometimes happen that a few species will continue to maintain
  themselves in areas where they are removed from the influences that
  exterminated their fellows.</p>

  <p><i>Cause of the Extinction of Species.</i>&mdash;There is good reason
  to believe that the most effective agent in the extinction of species is
  the pressure of other species, whether as enemies or merely as
  competitors. If therefore any portion of the earth is cut off from the
  influx of new or more highly organised animals, we may there expect to
  find the remains of groups which have elsewhere become extinct. In
  islands which have been long separated from their parent continents these
  conditions are exactly fulfilled, and it is in such places that we find
  the most striking examples of the preservation of fragments of primeval
  groups of animals, often widely separated from each other, owing to their
  having been preserved at remote portions of the area of the once
  widespread parental group. There are many other ways in which portions of
  dying out groups may be saved. Nocturnal or subterranean modes of life
  may save a species from enemies or competitors, and many of the ancient
  types still existing have such habits. The dense gloom of equatorial
  forests also affords means of concealment and protection, and we
  sometimes find in such localities a few remnants of low types in the
  midst of a general assemblage of higher forms. Some of the most ancient
  types now living inhabit caves like the Proteus, or bury themselves in
  mud like the Lepidosiren, or in sand like the Amphioxus, the last being
  the most primitive of all vertebrates; while the Galeopithecus and
  Tarsius of the Malay islands and the potto of West Africa, survive amid
  the higher mammalia of the Asiatic and African continents <!-- Page 64
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>{64}</span>owing to their
  nocturnal habits and concealment in the densest forests.</p>

  <p><i>The Rise and Decay of Species and Genera.</i>&mdash;The preceding
  sketch of the mode in which species and genera have arisen, have come to
  maturity, and then decay, leads us to some very important conclusions as
  to the mode of distribution of animals. When a species or a genus is
  increasing and spreading, it necessarily occupies a continuous area which
  gets larger and larger till it reaches a maximum; and we accordingly find
  that almost all extensive groups are thus continuous. When decay
  commences, and the group, ceasing to be in harmony with its environment,
  is encroached upon by other forms, the continuity may frequently be
  broken. Sometimes the outlying species may be the first to become
  extinct, and the group may simply diminish in area while keeping a
  compact central mass; but more often the process of extinction will be
  very irregular, and may even divide the group into two or more
  disconnected portions. This is the more likely to be the case because the
  most recently formed species, probably adapted to local conditions and
  therefore most removed from the general type of the group, will have the
  best chance of surviving, and these may exist at several isolated points
  of the area once occupied by the whole group. We may thus understand how
  the phenomenon of discontinuous areas has come about, and we may be sure
  that when allied species or varieties of the same species are found
  widely separated from each other, they were once connected by intervening
  forms or by each extending till it overlapped the other's area.</p>

  <p><i>Discontinuous Specific Areas, why Rare.</i>&mdash;But although
  discontinuous generic areas, or the separation from each other of species
  whose ancestors must once have occupied conterminous or overlapping
  areas, is of frequent occurrence, yet undoubted cases of discontinuous
  specific areas are very rare, except, as already stated, when one portion
  of a species inhabits an island. A few examples among mammalia have been
  referred to in our first chapter, but it may be said that these are
  examples of the very common phenomenon of a species being only found in
  the <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>{65}</span>station for which its organisation adapts
  it; so that forest or marsh or mountain animals are of course only found
  where there are forests, marshes, or mountains. This may be true, and
  when the separate forests or mountains inhabited by the same species are
  not far apart there is little that needs explanation; but in one of the
  cases referred to there was a gap of a thousand miles between two of the
  areas occupied by the species, and this being too far for the animal to
  traverse through an uncongenial territory, we are forced to the
  conclusion that it must at some former period and under different
  conditions have occupied a considerable portion of the intervening
  area.</p>

  <p>Among birds such cases of specific discontinuity are very rare and
  hardly ever quite satisfactory. This may be owing to birds being more
  rapidly influenced by changed conditions, so that when a species is
  divided the two portions almost always become modified into varieties or
  distinct species; while another reason may be that their powers of flight
  cause them to occupy on the average wider and less precisely defined
  areas than do the species of mammalia. It will be interesting therefore
  to examine the few cases on record, as we shall thereby obtain additional
  knowledge of the steps and processes by which the distribution of
  varieties and species has been brought about.</p>

      alt="Map shewing the distribution of Parus palustris" title="Map shewing the distribution of Parus palustris" /></a>
  </div>
  <p><i>Discontinuity of the Area of Parus palustris.</i>&mdash;Mr.
  Seebohm, who has travelled and collected in Europe, Siberia, and India,
  and possesses extensive and accurate knowledge of Palæarctic birds, has
  recently called attention to the varieties and sub-species of the marsh
  tit (<i>Parus palustris</i>), of which he has examined numerous specimens
  ranging from England to Japan.<a name="NtA_11"
  href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The curious point is that those of
  Southern Europe and of China are exactly alike, while all over Siberia a
  very distinct form occurs, forming the sub-species <i>P. borealis</i>.<a
  name="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> In Japan and Kamschatka
  other <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page66"></a>{66}</span>varieties are found, which have been named
  respectively <i>P. japonicus</i> and <i>P. camschatkensis</i> and another
  <i>P. songarus</i> in Turkestan and Mongolia. Now it all depends upon
  these forms being classed as sub-species or as true species whether this
  is or is not a case of discontinuous specific distribution. If <i>Parus
  borealis</i> is a distinct species from <i>Parus palustris</i>, as it is
  reckoned in Gray's <i>Hand List of Birds</i>, and also in Sharpe and
  Dresser's <i>Birds of Europe</i>, then <i>Parus palustris</i> has a most
  remarkable discontinuous distribution, as shown in the accompanying map,
  one portion of its area comprising Central and South Europe and Asia
  Minor, the other an undefined tract in Northern China, the two portions
  being thus situated in about the same latitude and having a very similar
  climate, but with a distance of about 4,000 miles between them. If,
  however, these two forms are reckoned as sub-species only, then the area
  of the species becomes continuous, while only one of its varieties or
  sub-species has a discontinuous area. It is a curious fact that <i>P.
  palustris</i> and <i>P. borealis</i> are found together in Southern
  Scandinavia and in some parts of Central Europe, and are said to differ
  somewhat in their note and their habits, as well as in colouration.</p>

  <p><i>Discontinuity of Emberiza sch&oelig;niclus.</i>&mdash;The other
  case is that of our reed bunting (<i>Emberiza sch&oelig;niclus</i>),
  which ranges over almost all Europe and Western Asia as far as the
  Yenesai valley and North-west India. It is then replaced by another
  smaller species, <i>E. passerina</i>, which ranges eastwards to the Lena
  river, and in winter as far south as Amoy in China; but in Japan the
  original species appears again, receiving a new name (<i>E.
  pyrrhulina</i>), but Mr. Seebohm assures us that it is quite
  indistinguishable from the European bird. Although the distance between
  these two portions of the species is not so great as in the last example,
  being about 2,000 miles, in other respects the case is an interesting
  one, because the forms which occupy the intervening space are recognised
  by Mr. Seebohm himself as undoubted species.<a name="NtA_13"
  href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span></p>

  <p><i>The European and Japanese Jays.</i>&mdash;Another case somewhat
  resembling that of the marsh tit is afforded by the European and Japanese
  jays (<i>Garrulus glandarius</i> and <i>G. japonicus</i>). Our common jay
  inhabits the whole of Europe except the extreme north, but is not known
  to extend anywhere into Asia, where it is represented by several quite
  distinct species. (See Map, Frontispiece.) But the great central island
  of Japan is inhabited by a jay (<i>G. japonicus</i>) which is very like
  ours, and was formerly classed as a sub-species only, in which case our
  jay would be considered to have a discontinuous distribution. But the
  specific distinctness of the Japanese bird is now universally admitted,
  and it is certainly a very remarkable fact that among the twelve species
  of jays which together range over all temperate Europe and Asia, one
  which is so closely allied to our English bird should be found at the
  remotest possible point from it. Looking at the map exhibiting the
  distribution of the several species, we can hardly avoid the conclusion
  that a bird very like our jay once occupied the whole area of the genus,
  that in various parts of Asia it became gradually modified into a variety
  of distinct species in the manner already explained, a remnant of the
  original type being preserved almost unchanged in Japan, owing probably
  to favourable conditions of climate and protection from competing
  forms.</p>

  <p><i>Supposed Examples of Discontinuity among North American
  Birds.</i>&mdash;In North America, the eastern and western provinces are
  so different in climate and vegetation, and are besides separated by such
  remarkable physical barriers&mdash;the arid central plains and the vast
  ranges of the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada, that we can hardly
  expect to find species whose areas may be divided maintaining their
  identity. Towards the north however the above-named barriers disappear,
  the forests being almost continuous from east to west, while the mountain
  range is broken up by passes and valleys. It thus happens that most
  species of birds which inhabit both the eastern and western coasts of the
  North American continent have maintained their continuity towards the
  north, while even when differentiated into two or more allied <!-- Page
  68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>{68}</span>species their
  areas are often conterminous or overlapping.</p>

  <p>Almost the only bird that seems to have a really discontinuous range
  is the species of wren, <i>Thryothorus bewickii</i>, of which the type
  form ranges from the east coast to Kansas and Minnesota, while a
  longer-billed variety, <i>T. bewickii spilurus</i>, is found in the
  wooded parts of California and as far north as Puget Sound. If this
  really represents the range of the species there remains a gap of about
  1,000 miles between its two disconnected areas. Other cases are those of
  <i>Vireo bellii</i> of the middle United States and the sub-species
  <i>pusillus</i> of California; and of the purple red-finch, <i>Carpodacus
  purpureus</i>, with its variety <i>C. californicus</i>; but unfortunately
  the exact limits of these varieties are in neither case known, and though
  each one is characteristic of its own province, it is possible that they
  may somewhere become conterminous, though in the case of the red-finches
  this does not seem likely to be the fact.</p>

  <p>In a later chapter we shall have to point out some remarkable cases of
  this kind where one portion of the species inhabits an island; but the
  facts now given are sufficient to prove that the discontinuity of the
  area occupied by a single homogeneous species, by two varieties of a
  species, by two well-marked sub-species, and by two closely allied but
  distinct species, are all different phases of one phenomenon&mdash;the
  decay of ill-adapted, and their replacement by better-adapted forms,
  under the pressure of a change of conditions either physical or organic.
  We may now proceed with our sketch of the mode of distribution of higher
  groups.</p>

  <p><i>Distribution and Antiquity of Families.</i>&mdash;Just as
  <i>genera</i> are groups of allied species distinguished from all other
  groups by some well-marked structural characters, so <i>families</i> are
  groups of allied genera distinguished by more marked and more important
  characters, which are generally accompanied by a peculiar outward form
  and style of colouration, and by distinctive habits and mode of life. As
  a genus is usually more ancient than any of the species of which it is
  composed, because during its growth and development the original
  rudimentary species becomes <!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page69"></a>{69}</span>supplanted by more and more perfectly
  adapted forms, so a family is usually older than its component genera,
  and during the long period of its life-history may have survived many and
  great terrestrial and organic changes. Many families of the higher
  animals have now an almost worldwide extension, or at least range over
  several continents; and it seems probable that all families which have
  survived long enough to develop a considerable variety of generic and
  specific forms have also at one time or other occupied an extensive
  area.</p>

  <p><i>Discontinuity a Proof of Antiquity.</i>&mdash;Discontinuity will
  therefore be an indication of antiquity, and the more widely the
  fragments are scattered the more ancient we may usually presume the
  parent group to be. A striking example is furnished by the strange
  reptilian fishes forming the order or sub-order Dipnoi, which includes
  the Lepidosiren and its allies. Only three or four living species are
  known, and these inhabit tropical rivers situated in the remotest
  continents. The <i>Lepidosiren paradoxa</i> is only known from the Amazon
  and some other South American rivers. An allied species, <i>Lepidosiren
  annectens</i>, sometimes placed in a distinct genus, inhabits the Gambia
  in West Africa, while the recent discovery in Eastern Australia of the
  Ceratodus or mud-fish of Queensland, adds another form to the same
  isolated group. Numerous fossil teeth, long known from the Triassic beds
  of this country, and also found in Germany and India in beds of the same
  age, agree so closely with those of the living Ceratodus that both are
  referred to the same genus. No more recent traces of any such animal have
  been discovered, but the Carboniferous Ctenodus and the Devonian Dipterus
  evidently belong to the same group, while in North America the Devonian
  rocks have yielded a gigantic allied form which has been named Heliodus
  by Professor Newberry. Thus an enormous range in time is accompanied by a
  very wide and scattered distribution of the existing species.</p>

  <p>Whenever, therefore, we find two or more living genera belonging to
  the same family or order but not very closely allied to each other, we
  may be sure that they are the remnants of a once extensive group of
  genera; and if we <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>{70}</span>find them now isolated in remote parts of
  the globe, the natural inference is that the family of which they are
  fragments once had an area embracing the countries in which they are
  found. Yet this simple and very obvious explanation has rarely been
  adopted by naturalists, who have instead imagined changes of land and sea
  to afford a direct passage from the one fragment to the other. If there
  were no cosmopolitan or very wide-spread families still existing, or even
  if such cases were rare, there would be some justification for such a
  proceeding; but as about one-fourth of the existing families of land
  mammalia have a range extending to at least three or four continents,
  while many which are now represented by disconnected genera are known to
  have occupied intervening lands or to have had an almost continuous
  distribution in tertiary times, all the presumptions are in favour of the
  former continuity of the group. We have also in many cases direct
  evidence that this former continuity was effected by means of existing
  continents, while in no single case has it been shown that such a
  continuity was impossible, and that it either was or must have been
  effected by means of continents now sunk beneath the ocean.</p>

  <p><i>Concluding Remarks.</i>&mdash;When writing on the subject of
  distribution it usually seems to have been forgotten that the theory of
  evolution absolutely necessitates the former existence of a whole series
  of extinct genera filling up the gap between the isolated genera which in
  many cases now alone exist; while it is almost an axiom of "natural
  selection" that such numerous forms of one type could only have been
  developed in a wide area and under varied conditions, implying a great
  lapse of time. In our succeeding chapters we shall show that the known
  and probable changes of sea and land, the known changes of climate, and
  the actual powers of dispersal of the different groups of animals, were
  such as would have enabled all the now disconnected groups to have once
  formed parts of a continuous series. Proofs of such former continuity are
  continually being obtained by the discovery of allied extinct forms in
  intervening lands, but the extreme imperfection of the geological record
  as regards land animals renders it <!-- Page 71 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>{71}</span>unlikely that this proof
  will be forthcoming in the majority of cases. The notion that if such
  animals ever existed their remains would certainly be found, is a
  superstition which, notwithstanding the efforts of Lyell and Darwin,
  still largely prevails among naturalists; but until it is got rid of no
  true notions of the former distribution of life upon the earth can be
  attained.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In order to understand the many curious anomalies we meet with in
  studying the distribution of animals and plants, and to be able to
  explain how it is that some species and genera have been able to spread
  widely over the globe, while others are confined to one hemisphere, to
  one continent, or even to a single mountain or a single island, we must
  make some inquiry into the different powers of dispersal of animals and
  plants, into the nature of the barriers that limit their migrations, and
  into the character of the geological or climatal changes which have
  favoured or checked such migrations.</p>

  <p>The first portion of the subject&mdash;that which relates to the
  various modes by which organisms can pass over wide areas of sea and
  land&mdash;has been fully treated by Sir Charles Lyell, by Mr. Darwin,
  and many other writers, and it will only be necessary here to give a very
  brief notice of the best known facts on the subject, which will be
  further referred to when we come to discuss the <!-- Page 73 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>{73}</span>particular cases that
  arise in regard to the faunas and floras of remote islands. But the other
  side of the question of dispersal&mdash;that which depends on geological
  and climatal changes&mdash;is in a far less satisfactory condition, for,
  though much has been written upon it, the most contradictory opinions
  still prevail, and at almost every step we find ourselves on the
  battle-field of opposing schools in geological or physical science. As,
  however, these questions lie at the very root of any general solution of
  the problems of distribution, I have given much time to a careful
  examination of the various theories that have been advanced, and the
  discussions to which they have given rise; and have arrived at some
  definite conclusions which I venture to hope may serve as the foundation
  for a better comprehension of these intricate problems. The four chapters
  which follow this are devoted to a full examination of these profoundly
  interesting and important questions, after which we shall enter upon our
  special inquiry&mdash;the nature and origin of insular faunas and
  floras.</p>

  <p><i>The Ocean as a Barrier to the Dispersal of Mammals.</i>&mdash;A
  wide extent of ocean forms an almost absolute barrier to the dispersal of
  all land animals, and of most of those which are aerial, since even birds
  cannot fly for thousands of miles without rest and without food, unless
  they are aquatic birds which can find both rest and food on the surface
  of the ocean. We may be sure, therefore, that without artificial help
  neither mammalia nor land birds can pass over very wide oceans. The exact
  width they can pass over is not determined, but we have a few facts to
  guide us. Contrary to the common notion, pigs can swim very well, and
  have been known to swim over five or six miles of sea, and the wide
  distribution of pigs in the islands of the Eastern Hemisphere may be due
  to this power. It is almost certain, however, that they would never
  voluntarily swim away from their native land, and if carried out to sea
  by a flood they would certainly endeavour to return to the shore. We
  cannot therefore believe that they would ever swim over fifty or a
  hundred miles of sea, and the same may be said of all the larger
  mammalia. <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>{74}</span>Deer also swim well, but there is no reason
  to believe that they would venture out of sight of land. With the
  smaller, and especially with the arboreal mammalia, there is a much more
  effectual way of passing over the sea, by means of floating trees, or
  those floating islands which are often formed at the mouths of great
  rivers. Sir Charles Lyell describes such floating islands which were
  encountered among the Moluccas, on which trees and shrubs were growing on
  a stratum of soil which even formed a white beach round the margin of
  each raft. Among the Philippine Islands similar rafts with trees growing
  on them have been seen after hurricanes; and it is easy to understand
  how, if the sea were tolerably calm, such a raft might be carried along
  by a current, aided by the wind acting on the trees, till after a passage
  of several weeks it might arrive safely on the shores of some land
  hundreds of miles away from its starting-point. Such small animals as
  squirrels and field-mice might have been carried away on the trees which
  formed part of such a raft, and might thus colonise a new island; though,
  as it would require a pair of the same species to be thus conveyed at the
  same time, such accidents would no doubt be rare. Insects, however, and
  land-shells would almost certainly be abundant on such a raft or island,
  and in this way we may account for the wide dispersal of many species of
  both these groups.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the occasional action of such causes, we cannot
  suppose that they have been effective in the dispersal of mammalia as a
  whole; and whenever we find that a considerable number of the mammals of
  two countries exhibit distinct marks of relationship, we may be sure that
  an actual land connection, or at all events an approach to within a very
  few miles of each other, has at one time existed. But a considerable
  number of identical mammalian families and even genera are actually found
  in all the great continents, and the present distribution of land upon
  the globe renders it easy to see how they have been able to disperse
  themselves so widely. All the great land masses radiate from the arctic
  regions as a common centre, the only break being at Behrings Strait,
  which is so shallow that a rise of less than a thousand feet would <!--
  Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>{75}</span>form a
  broad isthmus connecting Asia and America as far south as the parallel of
  60° N. Continuity of land therefore may be said to exist already for all
  parts of the world (except Australia and a number of large islands, which
  will be considered separately), and we have thus no difficulty in the way
  of that former wide diffusion of many groups, which we maintain to be the
  only explanation of most anomalies of distribution other than such as may
  be connected with unsuitability of climate.</p>

  <p><i>The Dispersal of Birds.</i>&mdash;Wherever mammals can migrate
  other vertebrates can generally follow with even greater facility. Birds,
  having the power of flight, can pass over wide arms of the sea, or even
  over extensive oceans, when these are, as in the Pacific, studded with
  islands to serve as resting places. Even the smaller land-birds are often
  carried by violent gales of wind from Europe to the Azores, a distance of
  nearly a thousand miles, so that it becomes comparatively easy to explain
  the exceptional distribution of certain species of birds. Yet on the
  whole it is remarkable how closely the majority of birds follow the same
  laws of distribution as mammals, showing that they generally require
  either continuous land or an island-strewn sea as a means of dispersal to
  new homes.</p>

  <p><i>The Dispersal of Reptiles.</i>&mdash;Reptiles appear at first sight
  to be as much dependent on land for their dispersal as mammalia, but they
  possess two peculiarities which favour their occasional transmission
  across the sea&mdash;the one being their greater tenacity of life, the
  other their oviparous mode of reproduction. A large boa-constrictor was
  once floated to the island of St. Vincent, twisted round the trunk of a
  cedar tree, and was so little injured by its voyage that it captured some
  sheep before it was killed. The island is nearly two hundred miles from
  Trinidad and the coast of South America, whence the reptile almost
  certainly came.<a name="NtA_14" href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Snakes
  are, however, comparatively scarce on islands far from continents, but
  lizards are often abundant, and though these might also travel on
  floating trees, it seems more probable that there <!-- Page 76 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span>is some as yet unknown
  mode by which their eggs are safely, though perhaps very rarely, conveyed
  from island to island. Examples of their peculiar distribution will be
  given when we treat of the fauna of some islands in which they
  abound.</p>

  <p><i>The Dispersal of Amphibia and Fresh-water Fishes.</i>&mdash;The two
  lower groups of vertebrates, Amphibia and fresh-water fishes, possess
  special facilities for dispersal, in the fact of their eggs being
  deposited in water, and in their aquatic or semi-aquatic habits. They
  have another advantage over reptiles in being capable of flourishing in
  arctic regions, and in the power possessed by their eggs of being frozen
  without injury. They have thus, no doubt, been assisted in their
  dispersal by floating ice, and by that approximation of all the
  continents in high northern latitudes which has been the chief agent in
  producing the general uniformity in the animal productions of the globe.
  Some genera of Batrachia have almost a world-wide distribution; while the
  tailed Batrachia, such as the newts and salamanders, are almost entirely
  confined to the northern hemisphere, some of the genera spreading over
  the whole of the north temperate zone. Fresh-water fishes have often a
  very wide range, the same species being sometimes found in all the rivers
  of a continent. This is no doubt chiefly due to the want of permanence in
  river basins, especially in their lower portions, where streams belonging
  to distinct systems often approach each other and may be made to change
  their course from one to the other basin by very slight elevations or
  depressions of the land. Hurricanes and water-spouts also often carry
  considerable quantities of water from ponds and rivers, and thus disperse
  eggs and even small fishes. As a rule, however, the same species are not
  often found in countries separated by a considerable extent of sea, and
  in the tropics rarely the same genera. The exceptions are in the colder
  regions of the earth, where the transporting power of ice may have come
  into play. High ranges of mountains, if continuous for long distances,
  rarely have the same species of fish in the rivers on their two sides.
  Where exceptions occur, it is often due to the great <!-- Page 77
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>{77}</span>antiquity of the
  group, which has survived so many changes in physical geography that it
  has been able, step by step, to reach countries which are separated by
  barriers impassable to more recent types. Yet another and more efficient
  explanation of the distribution of this group of animals is the fact that
  many families and genera inhabit both fresh and salt water; and there is
  reason to believe that many of the fishes now inhabiting the tropical
  rivers of both hemispheres have arisen from allied marine forms becoming
  gradually modified for a life in fresh water. By some of these various
  causes, or a combination of them, most of the facts in the distribution
  of fishes can be explained without much difficulty.</p>

  <p><i>The Dispersal of Insects.</i>&mdash;In the enormous group of
  insects the means of dispersal among land animals reach their maximum.
  Many of them have great powers of flight, and from their extreme
  lightness they can be carried immense distances by gales of wind. Others
  can survive exposure to salt water for many days, and may thus be floated
  long distances by marine currents. The eggs and larvæ often inhabit solid
  timber, or lurk under bark or in crevices of logs, and may thus reach any
  countries to which such logs are floated. Another important factor in the
  problem is the immense antiquity of insects, and the long persistence of
  many of the best marked types. The rich insect fauna of the Miocene
  period in Switzerland consisted largely of genera still inhabiting
  Europe, and even of a considerable number identical, or almost so, with
  living species. Out of 156 genera of Swiss fossil beetles no less than
  114 are still living; and the general character of the species is exactly
  like that of the existing fauna of the northern hemisphere in a somewhat
  more southern latitude. There is, therefore, evidently no difficulty in
  accounting for any amount of dispersal among insects; and it is all the
  more surprising that with such powers of migration they should yet be
  often as restricted in their range as the reptiles or even the mammalia.
  The cause of this wonderful restriction to limited areas is, undoubtedly,
  the extreme specialisation of most insects. They have become so exactly
  adapted to one set of conditions, that when <!-- Page 78 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>{78}</span>carried into a new
  country they cannot live. Many can only feed in the larva state on one
  species of plant; others are bound up with certain groups of animals on
  whom they are more or less parasitic. Climatal influences have a great
  effect on their delicate bodies; while, however well a species may be
  adapted to cope with its enemies in one locality, it may be quite unable
  to guard itself against those which elsewhere attack it. From this
  peculiar combination of characters it happens, that among insects are to
  be found examples of the widest and most erratic dispersal and also of
  the extremest restriction to limited areas; and it is only by bearing
  these considerations in mind that we can find a satisfactory explanation
  of the many anomalies we meet with in studying their distribution.</p>

  <p><i>The Dispersal of Land Mollusca.</i>&mdash;The only other group of
  animals we need now refer to is that of the air-breathing mollusca,
  commonly called land-shells. These are almost as ubiquitous as insects,
  though far less numerous; and their wide distribution is by no means so
  easy to explain. The genera have usually a very wide, and often a
  cosmopolitan range, while the species are rather restricted, and
  sometimes wonderfully so. Not only do single islands, however small,
  often possess peculiar species of land-shells, but sometimes single
  mountains or valleys, or even a particular mountain side, possess species
  or varieties found nowhere else upon the globe. It is pretty certain that
  they have no means of passing over the sea but such as are very rare and
  exceptional. Some which possess an operculum, or which close the mouth of
  the shell with a diaphragm of secreted mucus, may float across narrow
  arms of the sea, especially when protected in the crevices of logs of
  timber; while in the young state when attached to leaves or twigs they
  may be carried long distances by hurricanes.<a name="NtA_15"
  href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Owing to their exceedingly slow motion,
  <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>{79}</span>their powers of voluntary dispersal, even on
  land, are very limited, and this will explain the extreme restriction of
  their range in many cases.</p>

  <p><i>Great Antiquity of Land-Shells.</i>&mdash;The clue to the almost
  universal distribution of the several families and of many genera, is to
  be found, however, in their immense antiquity. In the Pliocene and
  Miocene formations most of the land-shells are either identical with
  living species or closely allied to them, while even in the Eocene almost
  all are of living genera, and one British Eocene fossil still lives in
  Texas. Strange to say, no true land-shells have been discovered in the
  Secondary formations, but they must certainly have abounded, for in the
  far more ancient Palæozoic coal measures of Nova Scotia two species
  belonging to the living genera Pupa and Zonites have been found in
  considerable abundance.</p>

  <p>Land-shells have therefore survived all the revolutions the earth has
  undergone since Palæozoic times. They have been able to spread slowly but
  surely into every land that has ever been connected with a continent,
  while the rare chances of transfer across the ocean, to which we have
  referred as possible, have again and again occurred during the almost
  unimaginable ages of their existence. The remotest and most solitary of
  the islands of the mid-ocean have thus become stocked with them, though
  the variety of species and genera bears a direct relation to the
  facilities of transfer, and the shell fauna is never very rich and
  varied, except in countries which have at one time or other been united
  to some continental land.</p>

  <p><i>Causes Favouring the Abundance of Land-Shells.</i>&mdash;The
  abundance and variety of land-shells is also, more than that of any other
  class of animals, dependent on the nature of the surface and the absence
  of enemies, and where these conditions are favourable their forms are
  wonderfully luxuriant. The first condition is the presence of lime in the
  soil, and a broken surface of country with much rugged <!-- Page 80
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>{80}</span>rock offering
  crevices for concealment and hibernation. The second is a limited bird
  and mammalian fauna, in which such species as are especially shell-eaters
  shall be rare or absent. Both these conditions are found in certain large
  islands, and pre-eminently in the Antilles, which possess more species of
  land-shells than any single continent. If we take the whole globe, more
  species of land-shells are found on the islands than on the
  continents&mdash;a state of things to which no approach is made in any
  other group of animals whatever, but which is perhaps explained by the
  considerations now suggested.</p>

  <p><i>The Dispersal of Plants.</i>&mdash;The ways in which plants are
  dispersed over the earth, and the special facilities they often possess
  for migration have been pointed out by eminent botanists, and a
  considerable space might be occupied in giving a summary of what has been
  written on the subject. In the present work, however, it is only in two
  or three chapters that I discuss the origin of insular floras in any
  detail; and it will therefore be advisable to adduce any special facts
  when they are required to support the argument in particular cases. A few
  general remarks only will therefore be made here.</p>

  <p><i>Special Adaptability of Seeds for Dispersal.</i>&mdash;Plants
  possess many great advantages over animals as regards the power of
  dispersal, since they are all propagated by seeds or spores, which are
  hardier than the eggs of even insects, and retain their vitality for a
  much longer time. Seeds may lie dormant for many years and then vegetate,
  while they endure extremes of heat, of cold, of drought, or of moisture
  which would almost always be fatal to animal germs. Among the causes of
  the dispersal of seeds De Candolle enumerates the wind, rivers, ocean
  currents, icebergs, birds and other animals, and human agency. Great
  numbers of seeds are specially adapted for transport by one or other of
  these agencies. Many are very light, and have winged appendages, pappus,
  or down, which enable them to be carried enormous distances. It is true,
  as De Candolle remarks, that we have no actual proofs of their being so
  carried; but this is not surprising when we consider how small and
  inconspicuous most seeds are. Supposing every <!-- Page 81 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>{81}</span>year a million seeds were
  brought by the wind to the British Isles from the Continent, this would
  be only ten to a square mile, and the observation of a life-time might
  never detect one; yet a hundredth part of this number would serve in a
  few centuries to stock an island like Britain with a great variety of
  continental plants.</p>

  <p>When, however, we consider the enormous quantity of seeds produced by
  plants, that great numbers of these are more or less adapted to be
  carried by the wind, and that winds of great violence and long duration
  occur in most parts of the world, we are as sure that seeds must be
  carried to great distances as if we had seen them so carried. Such storms
  carry leaves, hay, dust, and many small objects to a great height in the
  air, while many insects have been conveyed by them for hundreds of miles
  out to sea and far beyond what their unaided powers of flight could have
  effected.</p>

  <p><i>Birds as Agents in the Dispersal of Plants.</i>&mdash;Birds are
  undoubtedly important agents in the dispersal of plants over wide spaces
  of ocean, either by swallowing fruits and rejecting the seeds in a state
  fit for germination, or by the seeds becoming attached to the plumage of
  ground-nesting birds, or to the feet of aquatic birds embedded in small
  quantities of mud or earth. Illustrations of these various modes of
  transport will be found in Chapter XII. when discussing the origin of the
  flora of the Azores and Bermuda.</p>

  <p><i>Ocean-currents as Agents in
  Plant-dispersal.</i>&mdash;Ocean-currents are undoubtedly more important
  agents in conveying seeds of plants than they are in the case of any
  other organisms, and a considerable body of facts and experiments have
  been collected proving that seeds may sometimes be carried in this way
  many thousand miles and afterwards germinate. Mr. Darwin made a series of
  interesting experiments on this subject, some of which will be given in
  the chapter above referred to.</p>

  <p><i>Dispersal along Mountain Chains.</i>&mdash;These various modes of
  transport are, as will be shown when discussing special cases, amply
  sufficient to account for the vegetation found on oceanic islands, which
  almost always bears a close <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page82"></a>{82}</span>relation to that of the nearest continent;
  but there are other phenomena presented by the dispersal of species and
  genera of plants over very wide areas, especially when they occur in
  widely separated portions of the northern and southern hemispheres, that
  are not easily explained by such causes alone. It is here that
  transmission along <span class="correction" title="Original reads `mountains'."
  >mountain</span> chains has probably been effective; and the exact mode
  in which this has occurred is discussed in Chapter XXIII., where a
  considerable body of facts is given, showing that extensive migrations
  may be effected by a succession of moderate steps, owing to the frequent
  exposure of fresh surfaces of soil or <i>débris</i> on mountain sides and
  summits, offering stations on which foreign plants can temporarily
  establish themselves.</p>

  <p><i>Antiquity of Plants as affecting their Distribution.</i>&mdash;We
  have already referred to the importance of great antiquity in enabling us
  to account for the wide dispersal of some genera and species of insects
  and land-shells, and recent discoveries in fossil botany show that this
  cause has also had great influence in the case of plants. Rich floras
  have been discovered in the Miocene, the Eocene, and the Upper Cretaceous
  formations, and these consist almost wholly of living genera, and many of
  them of species very closely allied to existing forms. We have therefore
  every reason to believe that a large number of our plant-species have
  survived great geological, geographical, and climatal changes; and this
  fact, combined with the varied and wonderful powers of dispersal many of
  them possess, renders it far less difficult to understand the examples of
  wide distribution of the genera and species of plants than in the case of
  similar instances among animals. This subject will be further alluded to
  when discussing the origin of the New Zealand flora, in Chapter XXII.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The changes of land and sea which have occurred in particular cases
  will be described when we discuss the origin and relations of the faunas
  of the different classes of islands. We have here only to consider the
  general character and extent of such changes, and to correct some
  erroneous ideas which are prevalent on the subject.</p>

  <p><i>Changes of Land and Sea, their Nature and Extent.</i>&mdash;It is a
  very common belief that geological evidence proves a complete change of
  land and sea to have taken place over and over again. Every foot of dry
  land has undoubtedly, at one time or other, formed part of a sea-bottom,
  and we can hardly exclude the surfaces occupied by volcanic and
  fresh-water deposits, since, in many cases, if not in all, these rest
  upon a substratum of marine formations. At first sight, therefore, it
  seems a necessary inference that when the present continents were under
  water there must <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page84"></a>{84}</span>have been other continents situated where we
  now find the oceans, from which the sediments came to form the various
  deposits we now see. This view was held by so acute and learned a
  geologist as Sir Charles Lyell, who says:&mdash;"Continents, therefore,
  although permanent for whole geological epochs, shift their positions
  entirely in the course of ages."<a name="NtA_16"
  href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> Mr. T. Mellard Reade, late President of
  the Geological Society of Liverpool, so recently as 1878,
  says:&mdash;"While believing that the ocean-depths are of enormous age,
  it is impossible to resist other evidences that they have once been land.
  The very continuity of animal and vegetable life on the globe points to
  it. The molluscous fauna of the eastern coast of North America is very
  similar to that of Europe, and this could not have happened without
  littoral continuity, yet there are depths of 1,500 fathoms between these
  continents."<a name="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> It is
  certainly strange that a geologist should not remember the recent and
  long-continued warm climates of the Arctic regions, and see that a
  connection of Northern Europe by Iceland with Greenland and Labrador over
  a sea far less than a thousand fathoms deep would furnish the "littoral
  continuity" required. Again, in the same pamphlet Mr. Reade
  says:&mdash;"It can be mathematically demonstrated that the whole, or
  nearly the whole, of the sea-bottom has been at one time or other dry
  land. If it were not so, and the oscillations, of the level of the land
  with respect to the sea were confined within limits near the present
  continents, the results would have been a gradual diminution instead of
  development of the calcareous rocks. To state the case in common
  language, the calcareous portion of the rocks would have been washed out
  during the mutations, the destruction and redeposit of the continental
  rocks, and eventually deposited in the depths of the immutable sea far
  from land. Immense beds of limestone would now exist at the bottom of the
  ocean, while the land would be composed of sandstones and argillaceous
  shales. The evidence of chemistry thus confirms the inductions drawn from
  the distribution of animal life upon the globe."</p>

<p><!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span></p>

  <p>So far from this being a "mathematical demonstration," it appears to
  me to be a complete misinterpretation of the facts. Animals did not
  create the lime which they secrete from the sea-water, and therefore we
  have every reason to believe that the inorganic sources which originally
  supplied it still keep up that supply, though perhaps in diminished
  quantity. Again, the great lime-secreters&mdash;corals&mdash;work in
  water of moderate depth, that is, near land, while there is no proof
  whatever that there is any considerable accumulation of limestone at the
  bottom of the deep ocean. On the contrary, the fact ascertained by the
  <i>Challenger</i>, that beyond a certain depth the "calcareous" ooze
  ceases, and is replaced by red and grey clays, although the calcareous
  organisms still abound in the surface waters of the ocean, shows that the
  lime is dissolved again by the excess of carbonic acid usually found at
  great depths, and its accumulation thus prevented. As to the increase of
  limestones in recent as compared with older formations, it may be readily
  explained by two considerations: in the first place, the growth and
  development of the land in longer and more complex shore lines and the
  increase of sedimentary over volcanic formations may have offered more
  stations favourable to the growth of coral; while the solubility of
  limestone in rain-water renders the destruction of such rocks more rapid
  than that of sandstones and shales, and would thus, by supplying more
  calcareous matter in solution for secretion by limestone-forming
  organisms, lead to their comparative abundance in later as compared with
  earlier formations.</p>

  <p>However weak we may consider the above-quoted arguments against the
  permanence of oceans, the fact that these arguments are so confidently
  and authoritatively put forward, renders it advisable to show how many
  and what weighty considerations can be adduced to justify the opposite
  belief, which is now rapidly gaining ground among students of
  earth-history.</p>

  <p><i>Shore Deposits and Stratified Rocks.</i>&mdash;If we go round the
  shores of any of our continents we shall almost always find a
  considerable belt of shallow water, meaning thereby water from 100 to 150
  fathoms deep. The distance from the <!-- Page 86 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>{86}</span>coast line at which such
  depths are reached is seldom less than twenty miles, and is very
  frequently more than a hundred, while in some cases such shallow seas
  extend several hundred miles from existing continents. The great depth of
  a thousand fathoms is often reached at thirty miles from shore, but more
  frequently at about sixty or a hundred miles. Round the entire African
  coast for example, this depth is reached at distances varying from forty
  to a hundred and fifty miles (except in the Red Sea and the Straits of
  Mozambique), the average being about eighty miles.</p>

  <p>Now the numerous specimens of sea-bottoms collected during the voyage
  of the <i>Challenger</i> show that true shore-deposits&mdash;that is,
  materials denuded from the land and carried down as sediment by
  rivers&mdash;are almost always confined within a distance of 50 or 100
  miles of the coast, the finest mud only being sometimes carried 150 or
  rarely 200 miles. As the sediment varies in coarseness and density it is
  evident that it will sink to the bottom at unequal distances, the bulk of
  it sinking comparatively near shore, while only the very finest and
  almost impalpable mud will be carried out to the furthest limits. Beyond
  these limits the only deposits (with few exceptions) are organic,
  consisting of the shells of minute calcareous or siliceous organisms with
  some decomposed pumice and volcanic dust which floats out to mid-ocean.
  It follows, therefore, that by far the larger part of all stratified
  deposits, especially those which consist of sand or pebbles or any
  visible fragments of rock, must have been formed within 50 or 100 miles
  of then existing continents, or if at a greater distance, in shallow
  inland seas receiving deposits from more sides than one, or in certain
  exceptional areas where deep ocean currents carry the <i>débris</i> of
  land to greater distances.<a name="NtA_18"
  href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>{87}</span></p>

  <p>If we now examine the stratified rocks found in the very centre of all
  our great continents, we find them to consist of sandstones, limestones,
  conglomerates, or shales, which must, as we have seen, have been
  deposited within a comparatively short distance of a sea-shore. Sir
  Archibald Geikie says:&mdash;"Among the thickest masses of sedimentary
  rock&mdash;those of the ancient Palæozoic systems&mdash;no features recur
  more continually than the alternations of different sediments, and the
  recurrence of surfaces covered with well-preserved ripple-marks, trails
  and burrows of annelides, polygonal and irregular desiccation marks, like
  the cracks at the bottom of a sun-dried muddy pool. These phenomena
  unequivocally point to shallow and even littoral waters. They occur from
  bottom to top of formations, which reach a thickness of several thousand
  feet. They can be interpreted only in one way, viz., that the formations
  in question began to be laid down in shallow water; that during their
  formation the area of deposit gradually subsided for thousands of feet;
  yet that the rate of accumulation of sediment kept pace on the whole with
  this depression; and hence that the original shallow-water character of
  the deposits remained, even after the original sea-bottom had been buried
  under a vast mass of sedimentary matter." He goes on to say, that this
  general statement applies to the more recent as well as to the more
  ancient formations, and concludes&mdash;"In short, the more attentively
  the stratified rocks of the earth are studied, the more striking becomes
  the absence of any formations among them, which can legitimately be
  considered those of a deep sea. They have all been deposited in
  comparatively shallow water."<a name="NtA_19"
  href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The arrangement and succession of the stratified rocks also indicate
  the mode and place of their formation. We find them stretching across the
  country in one general direction, in belts of no great width though often
  of immense length, just as we should expect in shore deposits; and they
  often thin out and change from coarse to fine in a definite manner,
  indicating the position of the adjacent land <!-- Page 88 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>{88}</span>from the <i>débris</i> of
  which they were originally formed. Again quoting Sir Archibald
  Geikie:&mdash;"The materials carried down to the sea would arrange
  themselves then as they do still, the coarser portions nearest the shore,
  the finer silt and mud furthest from it. From the earliest geological
  times the great area of deposit has been, as it still is, the marginal
  belt of sea-floor skirting the land. It is there that nature has always
  strewn the dust of continents to be."</p>

  <p><i>The Movements of Continents.</i>&mdash;As we find these stratified
  rocks of different periods spread over almost the whole surface of
  existing continents where not occupied by igneous or metamorphic rocks,
  it follows that at one period or another each part of the continent has
  been under the sea, but at the same time not far from the shore.
  Geologists now recognise two kinds of movements by which the deposits so
  formed have been elevated into dry land&mdash;in the one case the strata
  remain almost level and undisturbed, in the other they are contorted and
  crumpled, often to an enormous extent. The former often prevails in
  plains and plateaus, while the latter is almost always found in the great
  mountain ranges. We are thus led to picture the land of the globe as a
  flexible area in a state of slow but incessant change; the changes
  consisting of low undulations which creep over the surface so as to
  elevate and depress limited portions in succession without perceptibly
  affecting their nearly horizontal position; and also of intense lateral
  compression, supposed to be produced by partial subsidence along certain
  lines of weakness in the earth's crust, the effect of which is to crumple
  the strata and force up certain areas in great contorted masses, which,
  when carved out by subaërial denudation into peaks and valleys,
  constitute our great mountain systems.<a name="NtA_20"
  href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> In this <!-- Page 89 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>{89}</span>way every part of a
  continent may again and again have sunk beneath the sea, and yet as a
  whole may never have ceased to exist as a continent or a vast continental
  archipelago. And, as subsidence will always be accompanied by deposition,
  of sediments from the adjacent land, piles of marine strata many thousand
  feet thick may have been formed in a sea which was never very deep, by
  means of a slow depression either continuous or intermittent, or through
  alternate subsidences and elevations, each of moderate amount.</p>

  <p><i>Supposed Oceanic Formations;&mdash;the Origin of
  Chalk.</i>&mdash;There seems very good reason to believe that few, if
  any, of the rocks known to geologists correspond exactly to the deposits
  now forming at the bottom of our great oceans. The white oceanic mud, or
  Globigerina-ooze, found in all the great oceans at depths varying from
  250 to nearly 3,000 fathoms, and almost constantly in depths under 2,000
  fathoms, has, however, been supposed to be an exception, and to
  correspond exactly to our white and grey chalk. Hence some naturalists
  have maintained that there has probably been one continuous formation of
  chalk in the Atlantic from the Cretaceous epoch to the present day. This
  view has been adopted chiefly on account of the similarity of the minute
  organisms found to compose a considerable proportion of both deposits,
  more especially the pelagic Foraminifera, of which several species of
  Globigerina appear to be identical in the chalk and the modern Atlantic
  mud. Other extremely minute organisms whose nature is doubtful, called
  coccoliths and discoliths, are also found in both formations, while there
  is a considerable general resemblance between the higher forms of life.
  Sir Wyville Thomson tells us, that&mdash;"Sponges are abundant in both,
  and the recent chalk-mud has yielded a large number of examples of the
  group <i>porifera vitrea</i>, which find their nearest representatives
  among the Ventriculites of the white chalk. The echinoderm fauna of the
  deeper parts of <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>the Atlantic basin is very characteristic,
  and yields an assemblage of forms which represent in a remarkable degree
  the corresponding group in the white chalk. Species of the genus Cidaris
  are numerous; some remarkable flexible forms of the Diademidæ seem to
  approach Echinothuria."<a name="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
  Now, as some explanation of the origin of chalk had long been desired by
  geologists, it is not surprising that the amount of resemblance shown to
  exist between it and some kinds of oceanic mud should have been at once
  seized upon, and the conclusion arrived at that chalk is a deep-sea
  oceanic formation exactly analogous to that which has been shown to cover
  large areas of the Atlantic, Pacific and Southern oceans.</p>

  <p>But there are several objections to this view which seem fatal to its
  acceptance. In the first place, no specimens of Globigerina-ooze from the
  deep ocean-bed yet examined agree even approximately with chalk in
  chemical composition, only containing from 44 to 79 per cent. of
  carbonate of lime, with from 5 to 11 per cent of silica, and from 8 to 33
  per cent. of alumina and oxide of iron.<a name="NtA_22"
  href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> Chalk, on the other hand, contains
  usually from 94 to 99 per cent. of carbonate of lime, and a very minute
  quantity of alumina and silica. This large proportion of carbonate of
  lime implies some other source of this mineral, and it is probably to be
  found in the excessively fine mud produced by the decomposition and
  denudation of coral reefs. Mr. Dana, the geologist of the United States
  Exploring Expedition, found in the elevated coral reef of Oahu, one of
  the Sandwich Islands, a deposit closely resembling chalk in colour,
  texture, &amp;c.; while in several growing reefs a similar formation of
  modern chalk undistinguishable from the ancient, was observed.<a
  name="NtA_23" href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> Sir Charles Lyell well
  remarks <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page91"></a>{91}</span>that the pure calcareous mud produced by the
  decomposition of the shelly coverings of mollusca and zoophytes would be
  much lighter than argillaceous or arenaceous mud, and being thus
  transported to greater distances would be completely separated from all
  impurities.</p>

  <p>Now the Globigerinæ have been shown by the <i>Challenger</i>
  explorations to abound in all moderately warm seas; living <!-- Page 92
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>{92}</span>both at the
  surface, at various depths in the water, and at the bottom. It was long
  thought that they were surface-dwellers only, and that their dead tests
  sank to the bottom, producing the Globigerina-ooze in those areas where
  other deposits were absent or scanty. But the examination of the whole of
  the dredgings and surface-gatherings of the <i>Challenger</i> by Mr.
  H.&nbsp;B. Brady has led him to a different conclusion; for he finds numerous
  forms at the bottom quite distinct from those which inhabit the surface,
  while, when the same species live both at surface and bottom, the latter
  are always larger and have thicker and stronger cell-walls. This view is
  also supported by the fact that in many stations not far from our own
  shores Globigerinæ are abundant in bottom dredgings, but are never found
  on the surface in the towing-nets.<a name="NtA_24"
  href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> These organisms then exist almost
  universally where the waters are pure and are not too cold, and they
  would naturally abound most where the diffusion of carbonate of lime both
  in suspension and solution afforded them an abundant supply of material
  for their shelly coverings. Dr. Wallich believes that they flourish best
  where the warm waters of the Gulf Stream bring organic matter from which
  they derive nutriment, since they are wholly wanting in the course of the
  Arctic current between Greenland and Labrador. Dr. Carpenter also assures
  us that they are rigorously limited to warm areas; but Mr. Brady says
  that a dwarf variety of Globigerina was found in the soundings of the
  North Polar Expedition in Lat. 83° 19&prime; N.</p>

  <p>Now with regard to the depth at which our chalk was formed, we have
  evidence of several distinct kinds to show that it was not profoundly
  oceanic. Mr. J. Murray, in the report already referred to, says: "The
  Globigerina-oozes which we get in shallow water resemble the chalk much
  more than those in deeper water, say over 1,000 fathoms."<a name="NtA_25"
  href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> This is important and weighty evidence,
  and it is supported in a striking manner by the nature of the molluscan
  fauna of the chalk. Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys, one of our greatest <!-- Page 93
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>{93}</span>authorities on
  shells, who has himself dredged largely both in deep and shallow water
  and who has no theory to support, has carefully examined this question.
  Taking the whole series of genera which are found in the Chalk formation,
  seventy-one in number, he declared that they are all comparatively
  shallow-water forms, many living at depths not exceeding 40 to 50
  fathoms, while some are confined to still shallower waters. Even more
  important is the fact that the genera especially characteristic of the
  deep Atlantic ooze&mdash;Leda, Verticordia, Neæra, and the Bulla
  family&mdash;are either very rare or entirely wanting in the ancient
  Cretaceous deposits.<a name="NtA_26"
  href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Let us now see how the various facts already adduced will enable us to
  explain the peculiar characteristics of the chalk formation. Sir Charles
  Lyell tells us that "pure chalk, of nearly uniform aspect and
  composition, is met with in a north-west and south-east direction, from
  the north of Ireland to the Crimea, a distance of about 1,500
  geographical miles; and in an opposite direction it extends from the
  south of Sweden to the south of Bordeaux, a distance of about 840
  geographical miles." This marks the extreme limits within which true
  chalk is found, though it is by no means continuous. It probably implies,
  however, the existence across Central Europe of a sea somewhat larger
  than the Mediterranean. It may have been much larger, because this pure
  chalk formation would only be formed at a considerable distance from
  land, or in areas where there was no other shore deposit. This sea was
  probably bounded on the north by the old Scandinavian highlands,
  extending to Northern Germany and North-western Russia, where Palæozoic
  and ancient Secondary rocks have a wide extension, though now partially
  concealed by late Tertiary deposits; while on the south it appears to
  have been limited by land extending through Austria, South Germany, and
  the south of France, as shown in the map of Central Europe during the
  Cretaceous period in Professor Heer's <i>Primeval World of
  Switzerland</i>, p. 175. To the north the sea may have had <!-- Page 94
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>{94}</span>an outlet to the
  Arctic Ocean between the Ural range and Finland. South of the Alps there
  was probably another sea, which may have communicated with the northern
  one just described, and there was also a narrow strait across
  Switzerland, north of the Alps, but, as might be expected, in this only
  marls, clays, sandstones, and limestones were deposited instead of true
  chalk. It is also a suggestive fact that both above and below the true
  chalk, in almost all the countries where it occurs, are extensive
  deposits of marls, clays, and even pure sands and sandstones,
  characterised by the same general types of fossil remains as the chalk
  itself. These beds imply the vicinity of land, and this is even more
  clearly proved by the occurrence, both in the Upper and Lower Cretaceous,
  of deposits containing the remains of land-plants in abundance,
  indicating a rich and varied flora.</p>

  <p>Now all these facts are totally opposed to the idea of anything like
  oceanic conditions having prevailed in Europe during the Cretaceous
  period; but they are quite consistent with the existence of a great
  Mediterranean sea of considerable depth in its central portions, and
  occupying either at one or successive periods, the whole area of the
  Cretaceous formation. We may also note that the Maestricht beds in
  Belgium and the Faxoe chalk in Denmark are both highly coralline, the
  latter being, in fact, as completely composed of corals as a modern
  coral-reef; so that we have here a clear indication of the source whence
  the white calcareous mud was derived which forms the basis of chalk. If
  we suppose that during this period the comparatively shallow sea-bottom
  between Scandinavia and Greenland was elevated, forming a land connection
  between these countries, the result would be that a large portion of the
  Gulf Stream would be diverted into the inland European sea, and would
  bring with it that abundance of Globigerinæ, and other Foraminifera,
  which form such an important constituent of chalk. This sea was probably
  bordered with islands and coral-reefs, and if no very large rivers flowed
  into it we should have all the conditions for the production of the true
  chalk, as well as the other members of the Cretaceous formation. The
  products <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95"></a>{95}</span>of the denudation of its shores and islands
  would form the various sandstones, marls, and clays, which would be
  deposited almost wholly within a few miles of its coasts; while the great
  central sea, perhaps at no time more than a few thousand feet deep and
  often much less, would receive only the impalpable mud of the coral-reefs
  and the constantly falling tests of Foraminifera. These would imbed and
  preserve for us the numerous echinoderms, sponges, and mollusca, which
  lived upon the bottom, the fishes and turtles which swam in its waters,
  and sometimes the winged reptiles that flew overhead. The abundance of
  ammonites, and other cephalopods, in the chalk, is another indication
  that the water in which they lived was not very deep, since Dr. S.&nbsp;P.
  Woodward thinks that these organisms were limited to a depth of about
  thirty fathoms.</p>

  <p>The best example of the modern formation of chalk is perhaps to be
  found on the coasts of sub-tropical North America, as described in the
  following passage:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The observations of Pourtales show that the steep banks of Bahama are
  covered with soft white lime mud. The lime-bottom, which consists almost
  entirely of Polythalamia, covers in greater depths the entire channel of
  Florida. This formation extends without interruption over the whole bed
  of the Gulf Stream in the Gulf of Mexico, and is continued along the
  Atlantic coast of America. The commonest genera met with in this deposit
  are Globigerina, Rotalia cultrata in large numbers, several Textilariæ,
  Marginulinæ, &amp;c. Beside these, small free corals, Alcyonidæ, Ophiuræ,
  Mollusca, Crustacea, small fishes, &amp;c., are found living in these
  depths. The whole sea-bottom appears to be covered with a vast deposit of
  white chalk still in formation."<a name="NtA_27"
  href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There is yet another consideration which seems to have been altogether
  overlooked by those who suppose that a deep and open island-studded ocean
  occupied the place of Europe in Cretaceous times. No fact is more certain
  than the considerable break, indicative of a great lapse of time,
  intervening between the Cretaceous and Tertiary <!-- Page 96 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>{96}</span>formations. A few
  deposits of intermediate age have indeed been found, but these have been
  generally allocated either with the Chalk or the Eocene, leaving the gap
  almost as pronounced as before. Now, what does this gap mean? It implies
  that when the deposition of the various Cretaceous beds of Europe came to
  an end they were raised above the sea-level and subject to extensive
  denudation, and that for a long but unknown period no extensive portion
  of what is now European land was below the sea-level. It was only when
  this period terminated that large areas in several parts of Europe became
  submerged and received the earliest Tertiary deposits known as Eocene.
  If, therefore, Europe at the close of the Cretaceous period was generally
  identical with what it is now, and perhaps even more extensive, it is
  absurd to suppose that it was all, or nearly all, under water during that
  period; or in fact, that any part of it was submerged, except those areas
  on which we actually find Cretaceous deposits, or where we have good
  reason to believe they have existed; and even these need not have been
  all under water at the same time.</p>

  <p>The several considerations now adduced are, I think, sufficient to
  show that the view put forth by some naturalists (and which has met with
  a somewhat hasty acceptance by geologists) that our white chalk is an
  oceanic formation strictly comparable with that now forming at depths of
  a thousand fathoms and upwards in the centre of the Atlantic, gives a
  totally erroneous idea of the actual condition of Europe during that
  period. Instead of being a wide ocean, with a few scattered islands,
  comparable to some parts of the Pacific, it formed as truly a portion of
  the great northern continent as it does now, although the inland seas of
  that epoch may have been more extensive and more numerous than they are
  at the present day.<a name="NtA_28" href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>{97}</span></p>

  <p><i>Fresh-water and Shore Deposits as Proving the Permanence of
  Continents.</i>&mdash;The view here maintained, that all known marine
  deposits have been formed near the coasts of continents and islands, and
  that our actual continents have been in continuous existence under
  variously modified forms during the whole period of known geological
  history, is further supported by another and totally distinct series of
  facts. In almost every period of geology, and in all the continents which
  have been well examined, there are found lacustrine, estuarine, or shore
  deposits, containing the remains of land animals or plants, thus
  demonstrating the continuous existence of extensive land areas on or
  adjoining the sites of our present continents. Beginning with the
  Miocene, or Middle Tertiary period, we have such deposits with remains of
  land-animals, or plants, in Devonshire and Scotland, in France,
  Switzerland, Germany, Croatia, Vienna, Greece, North India, Central
  India, Burmah, North America, both east and west of the Rocky Mountains,
  Greenland, and other parts of the Arctic regions. In the older Eocene
  period similar formations are widely spread in the south of England, in
  France, and to an enormous extent on the central plateau of North
  America; while in the eastern states, from Maryland to Alabama, there are
  extensive marine deposits of the same age, which, from the abundance of
  fossil remains of a large cetacean (Zeuglodon), must have been formed in
  shallow gulfs or estuaries where these huge animals were stranded. Going
  back to the Cretaceous formation we have the same indications of
  persisting lands in the rich plant-beds of Aix-la-Chapelle, and a few
  other localities on the Continent, as well as in coniferous fruits from
  the Gault of Folkestone; while in North America cretaceous plant-beds
  occur in <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page98"></a>{98}</span>New Jersey, Alabama, Kansas, the sources of
  the Missouri, the Rocky Mountains from New Mexico to the Arctic Ocean,
  Alaska, California, and in Greenland and Spitzbergen; while birds and
  land reptiles are found in the Cretaceous deposits of Colorado and other
  districts near the centre of the Continent. Fresh-water deposits of this
  age are also found on the coast of Brazil. In the lower part of this
  formation we have the fresh-water Wealden deposits of England, extending
  into France, Hanover, and Westphalia. In the older Oolite or Jurassic
  formation we have abundant proofs of continental conditions in the
  fresh-water and "dirt"-beds of the Purbecks in the south of England, with
  plants, insects and mammals; the Bavarian lithographic stone, with fossil
  birds and insects; the earlier "forest marble" of Wiltshire, with
  ripple-marks, wood, and broken shells, indicative of an extensive beach;
  the Stonesfield slate, with plants, insects, and marsupials; and the
  Oolitic coal of Yorkshire and Sutherlandshire. Beds of the same age occur
  in the Rocky Mountains of North America, containing abundance of
  Dinosaurians and other reptiles, among which is the Atlantosaurus, the
  largest land-animal yet known to have existed on the earth. Professor
  O.&nbsp;C. Marsh describes it as having been between fifty and sixty feet
  long, and when standing erect at least thirty feet high!<a name="NtA_29"
  href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> Such monsters could hardly have been
  developed except in an extensive land area. A small mammal, Dryolestes,
  has been discovered in the same deposits. A rich Jurassic flora has also
  been found in East Siberia and the Amur valley. The older Triassic
  deposits are very extensively developed in America, and both in the
  Connecticut valley and the Rocky Mountains show tracks or remains of land
  reptiles, amphibians and mammalia, while coalfields of the same age in
  Virginia and Carolina produce abundance of plants. Here too are found the
  ancient mammal, Microlestes, of Wurtemberg, with the ferns, conifers, and
  Labyrinthodonts of the Bunter Sandstone in Germany; while the beds of
  rock-salt in this formation, <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page99"></a>{99}</span>both in England and in many parts of the
  Continent, could only have been formed in inland seas or lakes, and thus
  equally demonstrate continental conditions.</p>

  <p>We now pass into the oldest or Palæozoic formations, but find no
  diminution in the proofs of continental conditions. The Permian formation
  has a rich flora often producing coal in England, France, Saxony,
  Thuringia, Silesia, and Eastern Russia. Coalfields of the same age occur
  in Ohio in North America. In the still more ancient Carboniferous
  formation we find the most remarkable proofs of the existence of our
  present land <span class="correction" title="Original reads `massses'."
  >masses</span> at that remote epoch, in the wonderful extension of coal
  beds in all the known continents. We find them in Ireland, England, and
  Scotland; in France, Spain, Belgium, Saxony, Prussia, Bohemia, Hungary,
  Sweden, Spitzbergen, Siberia, Russia, Greece, Turkey, and Persia; in many
  parts of continental India, extensively in China, and in Australia,
  Tasmania, and New Zealand. In North America there are immense coal
  fields, in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, from Pennsylvania southward to
  Alabama, in Indiana and Illinois, in Missouri, and even so far west as
  Colorado; and there is also a true coal formation in South Brazil. This
  wonderfully wide distribution of coal, implying, as it does, a rich
  vegetation and extensive land areas, carries back the proof of the
  persistence and general identity of our continents to a period so remote
  that none of the higher animal types had probably been developed. But we
  can go even further back than this, to the preceding Devonian formation,
  which was almost certainly an inland deposit often containing remains of
  fresh-water shells, plants, and even insects; while Professor Ramsay
  believes that he has found "sun-cracks and rain-pittings" in the Longmynd
  beds of the still earlier Cambrian formation.<a name="NtA_30"
  href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> If now, in addition to the body of
  evidence here adduced, we take into consideration the fresh-water
  deposits that still remain to be discovered, and those extensive areas
  where they have been destroyed by denudation or remain deeply covered up
  by later marine or volcanic formations, we cannot but be struck by the
  abounding proofs of the permanence of the <!-- Page 100 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>{100}</span>great features of land
  and sea as they now exist; and we shall see how utterly gratuitous, and
  how entirely opposed to all the evidence at our command, are the
  hypothetical continents bridging over the deep oceans, by the help of
  which it is so often attempted to cut the Gordian knot presented by some
  anomalous fact in geographical distribution.</p>

  <p><i>Oceanic Islands as Indications of the Permanence of Continents and
  Oceans.</i>&mdash;Coming to the question from the other side, Mr. Darwin
  has adduced an argument of considerable weight in favour of the
  permanence of the great oceans. He says (<i>Origin of Species</i>, 6th
  Ed. p. 288): "Looking to existing oceans, which are thrice as extensive
  as the land, we see them studded with many islands; but hardly one truly
  oceanic island (with the exception of New Zealand, if this can be called
  a truly oceanic island) is as yet known to afford even a fragment of any
  Palæozoic or Secondary formation. Hence we may perhaps infer that during
  the Palæozoic and Secondary periods neither continents nor continental
  islands existed where our oceans now extend; for had they existed,
  Palæozoic and Secondary formations would in all probability have been
  accumulated from sediment derived from their wear and tear; and these
  would have been at least partially upheaved by the oscillations of level,
  which must have intervened during these enormously long periods. If then
  we may infer anything from these facts, we may infer that, where our
  oceans now extend, oceans have extended from the remotest period of which
  we have any record; and, on the other hand, that where continents now
  exist, large tracts of land have existed, subjected no doubt to great
  oscillations of level, since the Cambrian period." This argument standing
  by itself has not received the attention it deserves, but coming in
  support of the long series of facts of an altogether distinct nature,
  going to show the permanence of continents, the cumulative effect of the
  whole must, I think, be admitted to be irresistible.<a name="NtA_31"
  href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>{101}</span></p>

  <p><i>General Stability of Continents with Constant Change of
  Form.</i>&mdash;It will be observed that the very same evidence which has
  been adduced to prove the <i>general</i> stability and permanence of our
  continental areas also goes to prove that they have been subjected to
  wonderful and repeated changes in <i>detail</i>. Every square mile of
  their surface has been again and again under water, sometimes a few
  hundred feet deep, sometimes perhaps several thousands. Lakes and inland
  seas have been formed, have been filled up with sediment, and been
  subsequently raised into hills or even mountains. Arms of the sea have
  existed crossing the continents in various directions, and thus
  completely isolating the divided portions for varying intervals. Seas
  have been changed into deserts and deserts into seas. Volcanoes have
  grown into mountains, have been degraded and sunk beneath the ocean, have
  been covered with sedimentary deposits, and again raised up into mountain
  ranges; while other mountains have been formed by the <!-- Page 102
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>{102}</span>upraised coral
  reefs of inland seas. The mountains of one period have disappeared by
  denudation or subsidence, while the mountains of the succeeding period
  have been rising from beneath the waves. The valleys, the ravines, and
  the mountain peaks, have been carved out and filled up again; and all the
  vegetable forms which clothe the earth and furnish food for the various
  classes of animals have been completely changed again and again.</p>

  <p><i>Effect of Continental Changes on the Distribution of
  Animals.</i>&mdash;It is impossible to exaggerate, or even adequately to
  conceive, the effect of these endless mutations on the animal world.
  Slowly but surely the whole population of living things must have been
  driven backward and forward from east to west, or from north to south,
  from one side of a continent or a hemisphere to the other. Owing to the
  remarkable continuity of all the land masses, animals and plants must
  have often been compelled to migrate into other continents, where in the
  struggle for existence under new conditions many would succumb; while
  such as were able to survive would constitute those wide-spread groups
  whose distribution often puzzles us. Owing to the repeated isolation of
  portions of continents for long periods, special forms of life would have
  time to be developed, which, when again brought into competition with the
  fauna from which they had been separated, would cause fresh struggles of
  ever increasing complexity, and thus lead to the development and
  preservation of every weapon, every habit, and every instinct, which
  could in any way conduce to the safety and preservation of the several
  species.</p>

  <p><i>Changed Distribution proved by the Extinct Animals of Different
  Epochs.</i>&mdash;We thus find that, while the inorganic world has been
  in a state of continual though very gradual change, the species of the
  organic world have also been slowly changing in form and in the
  localities they inhabit; and the records of these changes and these
  migrations are everywhere to be found, in the actual distribution of the
  species no less than in the fossil remains which are preserved in the
  rocks. Everywhere the animals which have most recently become extinct
  resemble more or less closely those which now live in the same country;
  and where <!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page103"></a>{103}</span>there are exceptions to the rule, we can
  generally trace them to some changed conditions which have led to the
  extinction of certain types. But when we go a little further back, to the
  late or middle Tertiary deposits, we almost always find, along with forms
  which might have been the ancestors of some now living, others which are
  only now found in remote regions and often in distinct
  continents&mdash;clear indications of those extensive migrations which
  have ever been going on. Every large island contains in its animal
  inhabitants a record of the period when it was last separated from the
  adjacent continent, while some portions of existing continents still show
  by the comparative poverty and speciality of their animals that at no
  distant epoch they were cut off by arms of the sea and formed islands. If
  the geological record were more perfect, or even if we had as good a
  knowledge of that record in all parts of the world as we have in Europe
  and North America, we could arrive at much more accurate results than we
  are able to do with our present very imperfect knowledge of extinct forms
  of life; but even with our present scanty information we are able to
  throw much light upon the past history of our globe and its inhabitants,
  and can sketch out with confidence many of the changes they must have
  undergone.</p>

  <p><i>Summary of Evidence for the General Permanence of Continents and
  Oceans.</i>&mdash;As this question of the permanence of our continents
  or, rather, of the continental areas, lies at the root of all our
  inquiries into the past changes of the earth and its inhabitants, and as
  it is at present completely ignored by many writers, and even by
  naturalists of eminence, it will be well to summarise the various kinds
  of evidence which go to establish it.<a name="NtA_32"
  href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> We know as a fact <!-- Page 104
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>{104}</span>that all
  sedimentary deposits have been formed under water, but we also know that
  they were largely formed in lakes or inland seas, or near the coasts of
  continents or great islands, and that deposits uniform in character and
  more than 150 or 200 miles wide were rarely, if ever, formed at the same
  time. The further we go from the land the less rapidly deposition takes
  place, hence the great bulk of all the strata must have been formed near
  land. Some deposits are, it is true, continually forming in the midst of
  the great oceans, but these are chiefly organic and increase very slowly,
  and there is no proof that any part of the series of known geological
  formations exactly resembles them. Chalk, which is still believed to be
  such a deposit by many naturalists, has been shown, by its contained
  fossils, to be a comparatively shallow water formation&mdash;that is, one
  formed at a depth measured by hundreds rather than by thousands of
  fathoms. The nature of the formations composing all our continents also
  proves the continuity of those continents. Everywhere we find clearly
  marked shore and estuarine deposits, showing that every part of the
  existing land has in turn been on the sea-shore; and we also find in all
  periods lacustrine formations of considerable extent with remains of
  plants and land animals, proving the existence of continents or extensive
  lands, in which such lakes or estuaries could be formed. These lacustrine
  deposits can be traced back through every period, from the newer Tertiary
  to the Devonian and Cambrian, and in every continent which has been
  geologically explored; and thus complete the proof that our continents
  have been in existence under ever changing <!-- Page 105 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>{105}</span>forms throughout the
  whole of that enormous lapse of time.</p>

  <p>On the side of the oceans we have also a great weight of evidence in
  favour of their permanence and stability. In addition to their enormous
  depths and great extent, and the circumstance that the deposits now
  forming in them are distinct from anything found upon the land-surface,
  we have the extraordinary fact that the countless islands scattered over
  their whole area (with one or two exceptions only and those comparatively
  near to continental areas) never contain any Palæozoic or Secondary
  rocks&mdash;that is, have not preserved any fragments of the supposed
  ancient continents, nor of the deposits which must have resulted from
  their denudation during the whole period of their existence! The supposed
  exceptions are New Zealand and the Seychelles Islands, both situated near
  to continents and not really oceanic, leaving almost the whole of the
  vast areas of the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Southern oceans, without
  a solitary relic of the great islands or continents supposed to have sunk
  beneath their waves.</p>

  the Glacial Epoch.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We have now to consider another set of physical revolutions which have
  profoundly affected the whole organic world. Besides the wonderful
  geological changes to which, as we have seen, all continents have been
  exposed, and which must, with extreme slowness, have brought about the
  greater features of the dispersal of animals and plants throughout the
  world, there has been also a long succession of climatal changes, which,
  though very slow and gradual when measured by centuries, may have
  sometimes been rapid as compared with the slow march of geological
  mutations.</p>

  <p>These climatal changes may be divided into two classes, which have
  been thought to be the opposite phases of the same great
  phenomenon&mdash;cold or even glacial epochs in the Temperate zones on
  the one hand, and mild or even warm periods extending into the Arctic
  regions on the <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page107"></a>{107}</span>other. The evidence for both these changes
  having occurred is conclusive; and as they must be taken account of
  whenever we endeavour to explain the past migrations and actual
  distribution of the animal world, a brief outline of the more important
  facts and of the conclusions they lead to must be here given.</p>

  <p><i>Proofs of the Recent Occurrence of a Glacial Epoch.</i>&mdash;The
  phenomena that prove the recent occurrence of glacial epochs in the
  temperate regions are exceedingly varied, and extend over very wide
  areas. It will be well therefore to state, first, what those facts are as
  exhibited in our own country, referring afterwards to similar phenomena
  in other parts of the world.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most striking of all the evidences of glaciation are the
  grooved, scratched, or striated rocks. These occur abundantly in
  Scotland, Cumberland, and North Wales, and no rational explanation of
  them has ever been given except that they were formed by glaciers. In
  many valleys, as, for instance, that of Llanberris in North Wales,
  hundreds of examples may be seen, consisting of deep grooves several
  inches wide, smaller furrows, and striæ of extreme fineness wherever the
  rock is of sufficiently close and hard texture to receive such marks.
  These grooves or scratches are often many yards long, they are found in
  the bed of the valley as well as high up on its sides, and they are
  almost all without exception in one general direction&mdash;that of the
  valley itself, even though the particular surface they are upon slopes in
  another direction. When the native covering of turf is cleared away from
  the rock the grooves and striæ are often found in great perfection, and
  there is reason to believe that such markings cover, or have once
  covered, a large part of the surface. Accompanying these markings we find
  another, hardly less curious phenomenon, the rounding off or planing down
  of the hardest rocks to a smooth undulating surface. Hard crystalline
  schists with their strata nearly vertical, and which one would expect to
  find exposing jagged edges, are found ground off to a perfectly smooth
  but never to a flat surface. These rounded surfaces are found not only on
  single rocks but over whole valleys and mountain sides, and form what
  <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page108"></a>{108}</span>are termed <i>roches moutonnées</i>, from
  their often having the appearance at a distance of sheep lying down.</p>

  <p>Now these two phenomena are actually produced by existing glaciers,
  while there is no other known or even conceivable cause that could have
  produced them. Whenever the Swiss glaciers retreat a little, as they
  sometimes do, the rocks in the bed of the valley they have passed over
  are found to be rounded, grooved, and striated just as are those of Wales
  and Scotland. The two sets of phenomena are so exactly identical that no
  one who has ever compared them can doubt that they are due to the same
  causes. But we have further and even more convincing evidence. Glaciers
  produce many other effects besides these two, and whatever effects they
  produce in Switzerland, in Norway, or in Greenland, we find examples of
  similar effects having been produced in our own country. The most
  striking of these are moraines and travelled blocks.</p>

  <p><i>Moraines.</i>&mdash;Almost every existing glacier carries down with
  it great masses of rock, stones, and earth, which fall on its surface
  from the precipices and mountain slopes which hem it in, or the rocky
  peaks which rise above it. As the glacier slowly moves downward, this
  <i>débris</i> forms long lines on each side, or on the centre whenever
  two glacier-streams unite, and is deposited at its termination in a huge
  mound called the terminal moraine. The decrease of a glacier may often be
  traced by successive old moraines across the valley up which it has
  retreated. When once seen and examined, these moraines can always be
  distinguished almost at a glance. Their position is most remarkable,
  having no apparent natural relation to the form of the valley or the
  surrounding slopes, so that they look like huge earthworks formed by man
  for purposes of defence. Their composition is equally peculiar,
  consisting of a mixture of earth and rocks of all sizes, usually without
  any arrangement, the rocks often being huge angular masses just as they
  had fallen from the surrounding precipices. Some of these rock masses
  often rest on the very top of the moraine in positions where no other
  natural force but that of ice could have placed them. <!-- Page 109
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>{109}</span>Exactly
  similar mounds are found in the valleys of North Wales and Scotland, and

    A GLACIER WITH MORAINES.

  <p><i>Travelled Blocks.</i>&mdash;The phenomenon of travelled or perched
  blocks is also a common one in all glacier countries, marking out very
  clearly the former extent of the ice. When a glacier fills a lateral
  valley, its foot will sometimes cross over the main valley and abut
  against its opposite slope, and it will deposit there some portion of its
  terminal moraine. But in these circumstances the end of the glacier not
  being confined laterally will spread out, <!-- Page 110 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>{110}</span>and the moraine matter
  will be distributed over a large surface, so that the only well-marked
  token of its presence will be the larger masses of rock that may have
  been brought down. Such blocks are found abundantly in many of the
  districts of our own country where other marks of glaciation exist, and
  they often rest on ridges or hillocks over which the ice has passed,
  these elevations consisting sometimes of loose material and sometimes of
  rock <i>different from that of which the blocks are composed</i>. These
  are called travelled blocks, and can almost always be traced to their
  source in one of the higher valleys from which the glacier descended.
  Some of the most remarkable examples of such travelled blocks are to be
  found on the southern slopes of the Jura. These consist of enormous
  angular blocks of granite, gneiss, and other crystalline rocks, quite
  foreign to the Jura mountains, but exactly agreeing with those of the
  Alpine range fifty miles away across the great central valley of
  Switzerland. One of the largest of these blocks is forty feet diameter,
  and is situated 900 feet above the level of the Lake of Neufchatel. These
  blocks have been proved by Swiss geologists to have been brought by the
  ancient glacier of the Rhone which was fed by the whole Alpine range from
  Mont Blanc to the Furka Pass. This glacier must have been many thousand
  feet thick at the mouth of the Rhone valley near the head of the Lake of
  Geneva, since it spread over the whole of the great valley of
  Switzerland, extending from Geneva to Neufchatel, Berne, and Soleure, and
  even on the flanks of the Jura, reached a maximum height of 2,015 feet
  above the valley. The numerous blocks scattered over the Jura for a
  distance of about a hundred miles vary considerably in the material of
  which they are composed, but they are found to be each traceable to a
  part of the Alps corresponding to their position, on the theory that they
  have been brought by a glacier spreading out from the Rhone valley. Thus,
  all the blocks situated to the east of a central point G (see map) can be
  traced to the eastern side of the Rhone valley (<i>l e d</i>), while
  those found towards Geneva have all come from the west side (<i>p h</i>).
  It is also very suggestive that the highest blocks on the <!-- Page 111
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>{111}</span>Jura at G have
  come from the eastern shoulder of Mont Blanc in the direct line <i>h</i>
  B F G. Here the glacier would naturally preserve its greatest thickness,
  while as it spread out eastward and westward it would become thinner. We
  accordingly find that the travelled blocks on either side of the central
  point become lower and lower, till near Soleure and Geneva they are not
  more than 500 feet above the valley. The evidence is altogether so
  conclusive that, after personal examination of the district in company
  with eminent Swiss geologists, Sir Charles Lyell gave up the <!-- Page
  112 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span>view he
  had first adopted&mdash;that the blocks had been carried by floating ice
  during a period of submergence&mdash;as altogether untenable.<a

  <p>The phenomena now described demonstrate a change of climate sufficient
  to cover all our higher mountains with perpetual snow, and fill the
  adjacent valleys with huge glaciers at least as extensive as those now
  found in Switzerland. But there are other phenomena, best developed in
  the northern part of our islands, which show that even this state of
  things was but the concluding phase of the glacial period, which, during
  its maximum development, must have reduced the northern half of our
  island to a condition only to be paralleled now in Greenland and the
  Antarctic regions. As few persons besides professed geologists are
  acquainted with the weight of evidence for this statement, and as it is
  most important for our purpose to understand the amount of the climatal
  changes the northern hemisphere has undergone, I will endeavour to make
  the evidence intelligible, referring my readers for full details to Dr.
  James Geikie's descriptions and illustrations.<a name="NtA_34"
  href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Glacial Deposits of Scotland: the "Till."</i>&mdash;Over almost all
  the lowlands and in most of the highland valleys of Scotland there are
  immense superficial deposits of clay, sand, gravel, or drift, which can
  be traced more or less directly to glacial action. Some of these are
  moraine matter, others are lacustrine deposits, while others again have
  been formed or modified by the sea during periods of submergence. But
  below them all, and often resting directly on the rock-surface, there are
  extensive layers of a very tough clayey deposit known as "till." The till
  is very fine in texture, very tenacious, and often of a rock-like
  hardness. It is always full of stones, all of which are of rude form, but
  with the angles rubbed off, and almost always covered with scratches and
  striæ often crossing each other in various directions. Sometimes the
  stones are so numerous that there seems to be only just enough clay to
  unite them into a solid mass, and they are of all sizes, from mere grit
  up to <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>{113}</span>rocks many feet in diameter. The "till" is
  found chiefly in the low-lying districts, where it covers extensive areas
  sometimes to a depth of a hundred feet; while in the highlands it occurs
  in much smaller patches, but in some of the broader valleys forms
  terraces which have been cut through by the streams. Occasionally it is
  found as high as two thousand feet above the sea, in hollows or
  hill-sides, where it seems to have been protected from denudation.</p>

  <p>The "till" is totally unstratified, and the rock-surfaces on which it
  almost always rests are invariably worn smooth, and much grooved and
  striated when the rock is hard; but when it is soft or jointed, it
  frequently shows a greatly broken surface. Its colour and texture, and
  the nature of the stones it contains, all correspond to the character of
  the rock of the district where it occurs, so that it is clearly a local
  formation. It is often found underneath moraines, drift, and other late
  glacial deposits, but never overlies them (except in special cases to be
  hereafter referred to), so that it is certainly an earlier deposit.</p>

  <p>Throughout Scotland, where "till" is found, the glacial striæ, perched
  blocks, <i>roches moutonnées</i>, and other marks of glacial action,
  occur very high up the mountains to at least 3,000 and often even to
  3,500 feet above the sea, while all lower hills and mountains are rounded
  and grooved on their very summits; and these grooves always radiate
  outwards from the highest peaks and ridges towards the valleys or the
  sea.</p>

  <p><i>Inferences from the Glacial Phenomena of Scotland.</i>&mdash;Now
  all these phenomena taken together render it certain that the whole of
  Scotland was once buried in a vast sea of ice, out of which only the
  highest mountains raised their summits. There is absolutely no escape
  from this conclusion; for the facts which lead to it are not
  local&mdash;found only in one spot or one valley&mdash;but general
  throughout the entire length and breadth of Scotland; and are besides
  supported by such a mass of detailed corroborative evidence as to amount
  to absolute demonstration. The weight of this vast ice-sheet, at least
  three thousand feet in maximum thickness, and continually moving seaward
  with a slow grinding motion like that of all existing glaciers, <!-- Page
  114 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>{114}</span>must have
  ground down the whole surface of the country, especially all the
  prominences, leaving the rounded rocks as well as the grooves and striæ
  we still see marking the direction of its motion. All the loose stones
  and rock-masses which lay on the surface would be pressed into the ice;
  the harder blocks would serve as scratching and grinding tools, and would
  thus themselves become rounded, scratched, and striated, as we see them,
  while all the softer masses would be ground up into impalpable mud along
  with the material planed off the rocky projections of the country,
  leaving them in the condition of <i>roches moutonnées</i>.</p>

  <p>The peculiar characters of the "till," its fineness and tenacity,
  correspond closely with the fine matter which now issues from under all
  glaciers, making the streams milky white, yellow, or brown, according to
  the nature of the rock. The sediment from such water is a fine unctuous,
  sticky deposit, only needing pressure to form it into a tenacious clay;
  and when "till" is exposed to the action of water, it dissolves into a
  similar soft, sticky, unctuous mud. The present glaciers of the Alps,
  being confined to valleys which carry off a large quantity of drainage
  water, lose this mud perhaps as rapidly as it is formed; but when the ice
  covered the whole country, there was comparatively little drainage water,
  and thus the mud and stones collected in vast compact masses in all the
  hollows, and especially in the lower flat valleys, so that, when the ice
  retreated, the whole country was more or less covered with it. It was
  then, no doubt, rapidly denuded by rain and rivers, but, as we have seen,
  great quantities remain to the present day to tell the tale of its
  wonderful formation.<a name="NtA_35"
  href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>{115}</span></p>

  <p>There is good evidence that, when the ice was at its maximum, it
  extended not only over the land, but far out to sea, covering all the
  Scottish islands, and stretching in one connected sheet to Ireland and
  Wales, where all the evidences of glaciation are as well marked as in
  Scotland, though the ice did not of course attain quite so great a
  thickness.<a name="NtA_36" href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>{116}</span></p>

  <p>It is evident that the change of climate requisite to produce such
  marvellous effects in the British Isles could not have been local, and we
  accordingly find strikingly similar proofs that Scandinavia and all
  northern Europe have also been covered with a huge ice-sheet; while we
  have already seen that a similar gigantic glacier buried the Alps,
  carrying granitic blocks to the Jura, where it deposited them at a height
  of 3,450 feet above the sea; while to the south, in the plains of Italy,
  the terminal moraines left by the retreating glaciers have formed
  extensive hills, those of Ivrea the work of the great glacier from the
  Val d'Aosta being fifteen miles across and from 700 to 1,500 feet
  high.</p>

  <p><i>Glacial Phenomena in North America.</i>&mdash;In North America the
  marks of glaciation are even more extensive and striking than in Europe,
  stretching over the whole of Canada and to the south of the great lakes
  as far as latitude 39°. There is, in all these countries, a wide-spread
  deposit like the "till" of Scotland, produced by the grinding of the
  great ice-sheet when it was at its maximum thickness; and also extensive
  beds of moraine-matter, true moraines, and travelled blocks, left by the
  glaciers as they retreated towards the mountains and finally withdrew
  into the upland valleys. There are, also, in Britain, Scandinavia, and
  North America, proofs of the submersion of the land beneath the sea to a
  depth of upwards of a thousand feet; but this is a subject we need not
  here enter upon, as our special object is to show the reality and amount
  of that wonderful and comparatively recent change of climate termed the
  glacial epoch.</p>

  <p>Many persons, even among scientific men, who have not given much
  attention to the question, look upon the whole subject of the glacial
  epoch as a geological theory made to explain certain phenomena which are
  otherwise a puzzle; and they would not be much surprised if they were
  some day told that it was all a delusion, and that Mr. So-and-so had
  explained the whole thing in a much more simple way. It is to prevent my
  readers being imposed upon by any such statements or doubts, that I have
  given this very brief and imperfect outline of the nature, extent, and
  completeness <!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page117"></a>{117}</span>of the evidence on which the existence of
  the glacial epoch depends. There is perhaps no great conclusion in any
  science which rests upon a surer foundation than this; and if we are to
  be guided by our reason at all in deducing the unknown from the known,
  the past from the present, we cannot refuse our assent to the reality of
  the glacial epoch of the northern hemisphere in all its more important
  features.</p>

  <p><i>Effects of the Glacial Epoch on Animal Life: Warm and Cold
  Periods.</i> &mdash;It is hardly necessary to point out what an important
  effect this great climatal cycle must have had upon all living things.
  When an icy mantle crept gradually over much of the northern hemisphere
  till large portions of Europe and North America were reduced to the
  condition of Greenland now, the greater part of the animal life must have
  been driven southward, causing a struggle for existence which must have
  led to the extermination of many forms, and the migration of others into
  new areas. But these effects must have been greatly multiplied and
  intensified if, as there is very good reason to believe, the glacial
  epoch itself&mdash;or at least the earlier and later phases of
  it&mdash;consisted of two or more alternations of warm and cold
  periods.</p>

  <p>The evidence that such was the case is very remarkable. The "till," as
  we have seen, could only have been formed when the country was entirely
  buried under a large ice-sheet of enormous thickness, and when it must
  therefore have been, in all the parts so covered, almost entirely
  destitute of animal and vegetable life. But in several places in Scotland
  fine layers of sand and gravel with beds of peaty matter, have been found
  resting on "till" and again covered by "till." Sometimes these
  intercalated beds are very thin, but in other cases they are twenty or
  thirty feet thick, and in them have been found remains of the extinct ox,
  the Irish elk, the horse, reindeer and mammoth. Here we have evidence of
  two distinct periods of intense cold, and an intervening milder period
  sufficiently prolonged for the country to become covered with vegetation
  and stocked with animal life. In some districts borings have proved the
  existence of no less than four <!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page118"></a>{118}</span>distinct formations of "till" separated
  from each other by beds of sand from two to twenty feet in thickness.<a
  name="NtA_37" href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> Facts of a similar nature
  have been observed in other parts of our islands. In the east of England,
  Mr. Skertchly (of the Geological Survey) enumerates four distinct boulder
  clays with intervening deposits of gravels and sands.<a name="NtA_38"
  href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> Mr. Searles V. Wood, Jun., classes the
  most recent (Hessle) boulder clay as "post-glacial," but he admits an
  intervening warmer period, characterised by southern forms of mollusca
  and insects, after which glacial conditions again prevailed with northern
  types of mollusca.<a name="NtA_39" href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
  Elsewhere he says: "Looking at the presence of such fluviatile mollusca
  as <i>Cyrena fluminalis</i> and <i>Unio littoralis</i> and of such
  mammalia as the hippopotamus and other great pachyderms, and of such a
  littoral Lusitanian fauna as that of the Selsea bed where it is mixed up
  with the remains of some of those pachyderms, as well as of some other
  features, it has seemed to me that the climate of the earlier part of the
  post-glacial period in England was possibly even warmer than our present
  climate; and that it was succeeded by a refrigeration sufficiently severe
  to cause ice to form all round our coasts, and glaciers to accumulate in
  the valleys of the mountain districts; and that this increased severity
  of climate was preceded, and partially accompanied, by a limited
  submergence, which nowhere apparently exceeded 300 feet, and reached that
  amount only in the northern counties of England."<a name="NtA_40"
  href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> This decided admission of an
  alternation of warm and cold climates since the height of the glacial
  epoch by so cautious a geologist as Mr. Wood is very important, as is his
  statement of an accompanying <i>depression</i> of the land, accompanying
  the increased cold, because many geologists maintain that a greater
  elevation of the land is the true and sufficient explanation of glacial
  periods.</p>

<p><!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>{119}</span></p>

  <p>Further evidence of this alternation is found both in the Isle of Man
  and in Ireland, where two distinct boulder clays have been described with
  intervening beds of gravels and sands.</p>

  <p><i>Palæontological Evidence of Alternate Cold and Warm
  Periods.</i>&mdash;Especially suggestive of a period warmer than the
  present, immediately following glacial conditions, is the occurrence of
  the hippopotamus in caves, brick-earths, and gravels of palæolithic age.
  Entire skeletons of this animal have been found at Leeds in a bed of dark
  blue clay overlaid by gravel. Further north at Kirkdale cave, in N. Lat.
  54° 15&prime;, remains of the hippopotamus occur abundantly along with
  those of the <i>Elephas antiquus</i>, <i>Rhinoceros hemit&oelig;chus</i>,
  reindeer, bear, horse, and other quadrupeds, and with countless remains
  of the hyænas which devoured them; while it has also been found in cave
  deposits in Glamorganshire, at Durdham Down near Bristol, and in the
  post-Pliocene drifts of England and France.</p>

  <p>The fact of the hippopotamus having lived at 54° N. Lat. in England
  immediately after the glacial period seems quite inconsistent with a mere
  gradual amelioration of climate from that time till the present day. The
  entirely tropical distribution of the existing animal and the large
  quantity of vegetable food which it requires both indicate a much warmer
  climate than now prevails in any part of Europe. The problem, however, is
  complicated by the fact that, both in the cave-deposits and river
  gravels, its remains are often found associated with those of animals
  that imply a cold climate, such as the reindeer, the mammoth, or the
  woolly rhinoceros. At this time the British Isles were joined to the
  Continent, and a great river formed by the union of the Rhine, the Elbe
  and all the eastern rivers of England, flowed northward through what is
  now the German Ocean. The hippopotamus appears to have been abundant in
  Central Europe before the glacial epoch, but during the height of the
  cold was probably driven to the south of France, whence it may have
  returned by way of the Rhone valley, some of the tributaries of that
  river approaching those of the Rhine within a mile or two a little
  south-west of Mulhausen, whence it would easily <!-- Page 120 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>{120}</span>reach Yorkshire.
  Professor Boyd Dawkins supposes that at this time our summers were warm,
  as in Middle Asia and the United States, while the winters were cold, and
  that the southern and northern animals migrated to and fro over the great
  plains which extended from Britain to the Continent. The following
  extract indicates how such a migration was calculated to bring about the
  peculiar association of sub-tropical and arctic forms.</p>

  <p>"It must not, however, be supposed that the southern animals migrated
  from the Mediterranean area as far north as Yorkshire in the same year,
  or the northern as far south as the Mediterranean. There were, as we
  shall see presently, secular changes of climate in Pleistocene Europe,
  and while the cold was at its maximum the arctic animals arrived at the
  southern limit, and while it was at its minimum the spotted hyæna and
  hippopotamus and other southern animals roamed to their northern limit.
  Thus every part of the middle zone has been successively the frontier
  between the northern and southern groups, and consequently their remains
  are mingled together in the caverns and river-deposits, under conditions
  which prove them to have been contemporaries in the same region. In some
  of the caverns, such as that of Kirkdale, the hyæna preyed upon the
  reindeer at one time of the year and the hippopotamus at another. In this
  manner the association of northern and southern animals may be explained
  by their migration according to the seasons; and their association over
  so wide an area as the middle zone, by the secular changes of climate by
  which each part of the zone in turn was traversed by the advancing and
  retreating animals."<a name="NtA_41"
  href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

  <p>When we consider that remains of the hippopotamus have been found in
  the caves of North Wales and Bristol as well as in those of Yorkshire,
  associated in all with the reindeer and in some with the woolly
  rhinoceros or the mammoth, and that the animal must have reached these
  localities by means of slow-flowing rivers or flooded marshes by very
  circuitous routes, we shall be convinced that these long journeys from
  the warmer regions of South <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>{121}</span>Europe could not have been made during the
  short summers of the glacial period. Thus the very existence of such an
  animal in such remote localities closely associated with those implying
  almost an arctic winter climate appears to afford a strong support to the
  argument for the existence of warm inter-glacial or post-glacial
  periods.</p>

  <p><i>Evidence of Interglacial Warm Periods on the Continent and in North
  America.</i>&mdash;Besides the evidence already adduced from our own
  islands, many similar facts have been noted in other countries. In
  Switzerland two glacial periods are distinctly recognised, between which
  was a warm period when vegetation was so luxuriant as to form beds of
  lignite sufficiently thick to be worked for coal. The plants found in
  these deposits are similar to those now inhabiting
  Switzerland&mdash;pines, oaks, birches, larch, etc., but numerous animal
  remains are also found, showing that the country was then inhabited by an
  elephant (<i>Elephas antiquus</i>), a rhinoceros (<i>Rhinoceros
  megarhinus</i>), the urus (<i>Bos primigenius</i>), the red deer
  (<i>Cervus elephas</i>), and the cave-bear, (<i>Ursus spel&oelig;us</i>);
  and there were also abundance of insects.<a name="NtA_42"
  href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In Sweden also there are two "tills," the lower one having been in
  places partly broken up and denuded before the upper one was deposited,
  but no interglacial deposits have yet been found. In North America more
  complete evidence has been obtained. On the shores of Lake Ontario
  sections are exposed showing three separate beds of "till" with
  intervening stratified deposits, the lower one of which has yielded many
  plant remains and fresh-water organisms. These deposits are seen to
  extend continuously for more than nine miles, and the fossiliferous
  interglacial beds attain a thickness of 140 feet. Similar beds have been
  discovered near Cleveland, Ohio, consisting, first of "till" at the
  lake-level, secondly of about 48 feet of sand and loam, and thirdly of
  unstratified "till" full of striated stones&mdash;six feet thick.<a
  name="NtA_43" href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> On the other side of the
  continent, in British Columbia, Mr. G.&nbsp;M. Dawson, geologist to the North
  American Boundary Commission, <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page122"></a>{122}</span>has discovered similar evidence of two
  glaciations divided from each other by a warm period.</p>

  <p>This remarkable series of observations, spread over so wide an area,
  seems to afford ample proof that the glacial epoch did not consist merely
  of one process of change, from a temperate to a cold and arctic climate,
  which having reached a maximum, then passed slowly and completely away;
  but that there were certainly two, and probably several more alternations
  of arctic and temperate climates.</p>

  <p>It is evident, however, that if there have been, not two only, but a
  series of such alternations of climate, we could not possibly expect to
  find more than the most slender indications of them, because each
  succeeding ice-sheet would necessarily grind down or otherwise destroy
  much of the superficial deposits left by its predecessors, while the
  torrents that must always have accompanied the melting of these huge
  masses of ice would wash away even such fragments as might have escaped
  the ice itself. It is a fortunate thing therefore, that we should find
  any fragments of these interglacial deposits containing animal and
  vegetable remains; and just as we should expect, the evidence they afford
  seems to show that the later phase of the cold period was less severe
  than the earlier. Of such deposits as were formed on land during the
  coming on of the glacial epoch when it was continually increasing in
  severity hardly a trace has been preserved, because each succeeding
  extension of the ice being greater and thicker than the last, destroyed
  what had gone before it till the maximum was reached.</p>

  <p><i>Migrations and Extinction of Organisms caused by the Glacial
  Epoch.</i>&mdash;Our last glacial epoch was accompanied by at least two
  considerable submergences and elevations of the land, and there is some
  reason to think, as we have already explained, that the two classes of
  phenomena are connected as cause and effect. We can easily see how such
  repeated submergences and elevations would increase and aggravate the
  migrations and extinctions that a glacial epoch is calculated to produce.
  We can therefore hardly fail to be right in attributing the wonderful
  changes in <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page123"></a>{123}</span>animal and vegetable life that have
  occurred in Europe and N. America between the Miocene Period and the
  present day, in part at least, to the two or more cold epochs that have
  probably intervened. These changes consist, first, in the extinction of a
  whole host of the higher animal forms, and secondly, in a complete change
  of types due to extinction and migration, leading to a much greater
  difference between the vegetable and animal forms of the eastern and
  western hemisphere than before existed. Many large and powerful mammalia
  lived in our own country in Pliocene times and apparently survived a part
  of the glacial epoch; but when it finally passed away they too had
  disappeared, some having become altogether extinct while others continued
  to exist in more southern lands. Among the first class are the
  sabre-toothed tiger, the extinct Siberian camel (Merycotherium), three
  species of elephant, two of rhinoceros, two bears, five species of deer,
  and the gigantic beaver; among the latter are the hyæna, bear, and lion,
  which are considered to be only varieties of those which once inhabited
  Britain. Down to Pliocene times the flora of Europe was very similar to
  that which now prevails in Eastern Asia and Eastern North America. The
  late Professor Asa Gray has pointed out that hundreds of species of trees
  and shrubs of peculiar genera which still flourish in those countries are
  now completely wanting in Europe, and there is good reason to believe
  that these were exterminated during the glacial period, being cut off
  from a southern migration, first by the Alps, and then by the
  Mediterranean; whereas in eastern America and Asia the mountain chains
  run in a north and south direction, and there is nothing to prevent the
  flora from having been preserved by a southward migration into a milder
  region.<a name="NtA_44" href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Our next two chapters will be devoted to a discussion of the causes
  which brought about the glacial epoch, and that still more extraordinary
  climatic phenomenon&mdash;the <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page124"></a>{124}</span>mild climate and luxuriant vegetation of
  the Arctic zone. If my readers will follow me with the care and attention
  so difficult and interesting a problem requires and deserves, they will
  find that I have grappled with all the more important facts which have to
  be accounted for, and have offered what I believe is the first complete
  and sufficient explanation of them. The important influence of climatal
  changes on the dispersal of animals and plants is a sufficient
  justification for introducing such a discussion into the present
  volume.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>No less than seven different causes have been at various times
  advanced to account for the glacial epoch and other changes of climate
  which the geological record proves to have taken place. These, as
  enumerated by Mr. Searles V. Wood, Jun., are as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. A decrease in the original heat of our planet.</p>

  <p>2. Changes in the obliquity of the ecliptic.</p>

  <p>3. The combined effect of the precession of the equinoxes and of the
  excentricity of the earth's orbit.</p>

  <p>4. Changes in the distribution of land and water. <!-- Page 126
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>{126}</span></p>

  <p>5. Changes in the position of the earth's axis of rotation.</p>

  <p>6. A variation in the amount of heat radiated by the sun.</p>

  <p>7. A variation in the temperature of space.</p>

  <p>Of the above, causes (1) and (2) are undoubted realities; but it is
  now generally admitted that they are utterly inadequate to produce the
  observed effects. Causes (5) (6) and (7) are all purely hypothetical, for
  though such changes may have occurred there is no evidence that they have
  occurred during geological time; and it is besides certain that they
  would not, either singly or combined, be adequate to explain the whole of
  the phenomena. There remain causes (3) and (4), which have the advantage
  of being demonstrated facts, and which are universally admitted to be
  capable of producing <i>some</i> effect of the nature required, the only
  question being whether, either alone or in combination, they are adequate
  to produce all the observed effects. It is therefore to these two causes
  that we shall confine our inquiry, taking first those astronomical causes
  whose complex and wide reaching effects have been so admirably explained
  and discussed by Dr. Croll in numerous papers and in his
  work&mdash;"Climate and Time in their Geological Relations."</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Astronomical Causes of Changes of Climate.</i>&mdash;The earth
  moves in an elliptical orbit round the sun, which is situated in one of
  the foci of the ellipse, so that the distance of the sun from us varies
  during the year to a considerable amount. Strange to say we are now three
  millions of miles nearer to the sun in winter than in summer, while the
  reverse is the case in the southern hemisphere; and this must have some
  effect in making our northern winters less severe than those of the south
  temperate zone. But the earth moves more rapidly in that part of its
  orbit which is nearer to the sun, so that our winter is not only milder,
  but several days shorter, than that of the southern hemisphere. The
  distribution of land and sea and other local causes prevent us from
  making any accurate estimate of the effects due to these differences; but
  there can be no doubt that if our winter were as long as our summer is
  now <!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page127"></a>{127}</span>and we were also three million miles
  further from the sun at the former period, a very decided difference of
  climate would result&mdash;our winter would be colder and longer, our
  summer hotter and shorter. Now there is a combination of astronomical
  revolutions (the precession of the equinoxes and the motion of the
  aphelion) which actually brings this change about every 10,500 years, so
  that after this interval the condition of the two hemispheres is reversed
  as regards nearness to the sun in summer, and comparative duration of
  summer and winter; and this change has been going on throughout all
  geological periods. (<i>See</i> Diagram.) The influence of the present
  phase of precession is perhaps seen in the great extension of the
  antarctic ice-fields, and the existence of glaciers at the sea-level in
  the southern hemisphere, in latitudes corresponding to that of England;
  but it is not supposed that similar effects were produced with us at the
  last cold period, 10,500 years ago, because we are exceptionally
  favoured, by the Gulf-stream warming the whole North Atlantic ocean and
  by the prevalence of westerly winds which convey that warmth to our
  shores; and also by the comparatively small quantity of high land around
  the North Pole which does not encourage great accumulations of ice. But
  besides this change in the relation of our seasons to the earth's
  <i>aphelion</i> and <i>perihelion</i> there is another and still more
  important astronomical <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page128"></a>{128}</span>factor in the change of magnitude of the
  excentricity itself. This varies very largely, though very slowly, and it
  is now nearly at a minimum. It also varies very irregularly; but its
  amount has been calculated for several million years back. Fifty thousand
  years ago it was rather less than it is now, but it then increased, and
  when we come to a hundred thousand years ago there is a difference of
  eight and a half millions of miles between our distance from the sun in
  <i>aphelion</i> and <i>perihelion</i> (as the most distant and nearest
  points of the earth's orbit are termed). At a hundred and fifty thousand
  years back it had decreased somewhat&mdash;to six millions of miles; but
  then it increased again, till at two hundred thousand years ago it was
  ten and a quarter, and at two hundred and ten thousand years ten and a
  half millions of miles. By reference to the accompanying diagram, which
  includes the last great period of excentricity, we find, that for the
  immense period of a hundred and sixty thousand years (commencing about
  eighty thousand <!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page129"></a>{129}</span>years ago) the excentricity was very
  great, reaching a maximum of three and a half times its present amount at
  almost the remotest part of this period, at which time the length of
  summer in one hemisphere and of winter in the other would be nearly
  twenty-eight days in excess. Now, during all this time, our position
  would change, as above described (and as indicated on the diagram), every
  ten thousand five hundred years; so that we should have alternate periods
  of very long and cold winters with short hot summers, and short mild
  winters with long cool summers. In order to understand the important
  effects which this would produce we must ascertain two
  things&mdash;first, what actual difference of temperature would be caused
  by varying distances of the sun, and, secondly, what are the properties
  of snow and ice in regard to climate.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Differences of Temperature Caused by Varying Distances of the
  Sun.</i>&mdash;On this subject comparatively few persons have correct
  ideas owing to the unscientific manner in which we reckon heat by our
  thermometers. The zero of Fahrenheit's thermometer is thirty-two degrees
  below the freezing point of water, and that of the centigrade
  thermometer, the freezing point itself, both of which are equally
  misleading when applied to cosmical problems. If we say that the mean
  temperature of a place is 50° F., or 10° C., these figures tell us
  nothing of how much the sun warms that place, because if the sun were
  withdrawn the temperature would fall far below either of the zero points.
  In the last Arctic Expedition a temperature of -74° F. was registered, or
  106° below the freezing point of water; and as at the same time the
  earth, at a depth of two feet, was only, -13° F. and the sea water +28°
  F., both influencing the temperature of the air, we may be sure that even
  this intense cold was not near the possible minimum temperature. By
  various calculations and experiments which cannot be entered upon here,
  it has been determined that the temperature of space, independent of
  solar (but not of stellar) influence, is about -239° F., and physicists
  almost universally adopt this quantity in all estimates of cosmical
  temperature. It follows, that if the mean temperature of the earth's
  surface at any time is 50° F. it is really warmed <!-- Page 130 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>{130}</span>by the sun to an amount
  measured by 50 + 239 = 289° F., which is hence termed its absolute
  temperature. Now during the time of the glacial epoch the greatest
  distance of the sun in winter was 98¼ millions of miles, whereas it is
  now, in winter, only 91½ millions of miles, the mean distance being taken
  as 93 million miles. But the quantity of heat received from the sun is
  inversely as the square of the distance, so that it would then be in the
  proportion of 8,372 to 9,613 now, or nearly one seventh less than its
  present amount. The mean temperature of England in January is about 37°
  F., which equals 276° F. of absolute temperature. But the above-named
  fraction of 276° is 237, the difference, 39, representing the amount
  which must be deducted to obtain the January temperature during the
  glacial epoch, which will therefore be -2° F. But this is a purely
  theoretic result. The actual temperature at that time might have been
  very different from this, because the temperature of a place does not
  depend so much on the amount of heat it receives directly from the sun,
  as on the amount brought to it or carried away from it by warm or cold
  winds. We often have it bitterly cold in the middle of May when we are
  receiving as much sun heat as many parts of the tropics, but we get cold
  winds from the iceberg-laden North Atlantic, and this largely neutralises
  the effect of the sun. So we often have it very mild in December if
  south-westerly winds bring us warm moist air from the Gulf-stream. But
  though the above method does not give correct results for any one time or
  place, it will be more nearly correct for very large areas, because all
  the sensible surface-heat which produces climates necessarily comes from
  the sun, and its proportionate amount may be very nearly calculated in
  the manner above described. We may therefore say, generally, that during
  our winter, at the time of the glacial epoch, the northern hemisphere was
  receiving so much less heat from the sun as was calculated to lower its
  surface temperature on an average about 39° F., while during the height
  of summer of the same period it would be receiving so much more heat as
  would suffice, other conditions being equal, to raise its mean
  temperature about 48° above what it is now. <!-- Page 131 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>{131}</span>The winter, moreover,
  would be long and the summer short, the difference being twenty-six
  days.</p>

  <p>We have here certainly an amount of cold in winter amply sufficient to
  produce a glacial period,<a name="NtA_45"
  href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> especially as this cold would be long
  continued; but at the same time we should have almost tropical heat in
  summer, although that season would be somewhat shorter. How then, it may
  be asked, could such a climate have the effect supposed? Would not the
  snow that fell in winter be all melted by the excessively hot summer? In
  order to answer this question we must take account of certain properties
  of water and air, snow and ice, to which due weight has not been given by
  writers on this subject.</p>

  <p><i>Properties of Air and Water, Snow and Ice, in Relation to
  Climate.</i>&mdash;The great aerial ocean which surrounds us has the
  wonderful property of allowing the heat-rays from the sun to pass through
  it without its being warmed by them; but when the earth is heated the air
  gets warmed by contact with it, and also to a considerable extent by the
  heat radiated from the warm earth, because, although pure dry <!-- Page
  132 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>{132}</span>air allows
  such dark heat-rays to pass freely, yet the aqueous vapour and carbonic
  acid in the air intercept and absorb them. But the air thus warmed by the
  earth is in continual motion owing to changes of density. It rises up and
  flows off, owing to the greater weight of the cooler air which forces it
  up and takes its place; and thus heat can never accumulate in the
  atmosphere beyond a very moderate degree, the excessive sun-heat of the
  tropics being much of it carried away to the upper atmosphere and
  radiated into space. Water also is very mobile; and although it receives
  and stores up a great deal of heat, it is for ever dispersing it over the
  earth. The rain which brings down a certain portion of heat from the
  atmosphere, and which often absorbs heat from the earth on which it
  falls, flows away in streams to the ocean; while the ocean itself,
  constantly impelled by the winds, forms great currents, which carry off
  the surplus heated water of the tropics to the temperate and even to the
  polar regions, while colder water flows from the poles to ameliorate the
  heat of the tropics. An immense quantity of sun-heat is also used up in
  evaporating water, and the vapour thus produced is conveyed by the aerial
  currents to distant countries, where, on being condensed into rain, it
  gives up much of this heat to the earth and atmosphere.</p>

  <p>The power of water in carrying away heat is well exhibited by the fact
  of the abnormally high temperature of arid deserts and of very dry
  countries generally; while the still more powerful influence of moving
  air may be appreciated, by considering the effects of even our northern
  sun in heating a tightly-closed glass house to far above the temperature
  produced by the vertical sun of the equator where the free air and
  abundance of moisture exert their beneficial influence. Were it not for
  the large proportion of the sun's heat carried away by air and water the
  tropics would become uninhabitable furnaces&mdash;as would indeed
  <i>any</i> part of the earth where the sun shone brightly throughout a
  summer's day.</p>

  <p>We see, therefore, that the excess of heat derived from the sun at any
  place cannot be stored up to an important amount owing to the wonderful
  dispersing agency of air <!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page133"></a>{133}</span>and water; and though some heat does
  penetrate the ground and is stored up there, this is so little in
  proportion to the whole amount received, and the larger part of it is so
  soon given out from the surface layers, that any surplus heat that may be
  thus preserved during one summer of the temperate zones rarely or never
  remains in sufficient quantity to affect the temperature of the
  succeeding summer, so that there is no such thing as an accumulation of
  earth-heat from year to year. But, though heat cannot, cold can be stored
  up to an almost unlimited amount, owing to the peculiar property water
  possesses of becoming solid at a moderately low temperature; and as this
  is a subject of the very greatest importance to our inquiry&mdash;the
  whole question of the possibility of glacial epochs and warm periods
  depending on it&mdash;we must consider it in some detail.</p>

  <p><i>Effects of Snow on Climate.</i>&mdash;Let us then examine the very
  different effects produced by water falling as a liquid in the form of
  rain, or as a solid in the form of snow, although the two may not differ
  from each other more than two or three degrees in temperature. The rain,
  however much of it may fall, runs off rapidly into streams and rivers,
  and soon reaches the ocean, a small portion only sinking into the earth
  and another portion evaporating into the atmosphere. If cold it cools the
  air and the earth somewhat while passing through or over them, but
  produces no permanent effect on temperature, because a few hours of
  sunshine restore to the air or the surface-soil all the heat they had
  lost. But if snow falls for a long time, the effect, as we all know, is
  very different, <i>because it has no mobility</i>. It remains where it
  fell and becomes compacted into a mass, and it then keeps the earth below
  it and the air above, at or near the freezing-point till it is all
  melted. If the quantity is great it may take days or weeks to melt; and
  if snow continues falling it goes on accumulating all over the surface of
  a country (which water cannot do), and may thus form such a mass that the
  warmth of the whole succeeding summer may not be able to melt it. It then
  produces perpetual snow, such as we find above a certain altitude on all
  the great mountains of the globe; and when this takes place <i>cold</i>
  is rendered permanent, no amount of <!-- Page 134 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>{134}</span>sun-heat warming the
  air or the earth much above the freezing-point. This is illustrated by
  the often-quoted fact that, at 80° N. Lat., Captain Scoresby had the
  pitch melted on one side of his ship by the heat of the sun, while water
  was freezing on the other side owing to the coldness of the air.</p>

  <p>The quantity of heat required to melt ice or snow is very great, as we
  all know by experience of the long time masses of snow will remain
  unmelted even in warm weather. We shall however be better able to
  appreciate the great effect this has upon climate, by a few figures
  showing what this amount really is. In order to melt one cubic foot of
  ice, as much heat is required as would heat a cubic foot of water from
  the freezing point to 176° F., or two cubic feet to 88° F. To melt a
  layer of ice a foot thick will therefore use up as much heat as would
  raise a layer of ice-cold water two feet thick to the temperature of 88°
  F.; and the effect becomes still more easily understood if we estimate it
  as applied to air, for to melt a layer of ice only 1½ inches thick would
  require as much heat as would raise a stratum of air 800 feet thick from
  the freezing point to the tropical heat of 88° F.! We thus obtain a good
  idea, both of the wonderful power of snow and ice in keeping down
  temperature, and also of the reason why it requires so long a time to
  melt away, and is able to go on accumulating to such an extent as to
  become permanent. These properties would, however, be of no avail if it
  were liquid, like water; hence it is the state of solidity and almost
  complete immobility of ice that enables it to produce by its accumulation
  such extraordinary effects in physical geography and in climate, as we
  see in the glaciers of Switzerland and the ice-capped interior of
  Greenland.</p>

  <p><i>High Land and great Moisture Essential to the Initiation of a
  Glacial Epoch.</i>&mdash;Another point of great importance in connection
  with this subject, is the fact, that this permanent storing up of cold
  depends entirely on the annual amount of snow-fall in proportion to that
  of the sun and air-heat, and not on the actual cold of winter, or even on
  the average cold of the year.<a name="NtA_46"
  href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> A place may be intensely cold in winter
  and may have a short arctic summer, yet, if <!-- Page 135 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>{135}</span>so little snow falls
  that it is quickly melted by the returning sun, there is nothing to
  prevent the summer being hot and the earth producing a luxuriant
  vegetation. As an example of this we have great forests in the extreme
  north of Asia and America where the winters are colder and the summers
  shorter than in Greenland in Lat. 62° N., or than in Heard Island and
  South Georgia, both in Lat. 53° S. in the Southern Ocean, and almost
  wholly covered with perpetual snow and ice. At the "Jardin" on the Mount
  Blanc range, above the line of perpetual snow, a thermometer in an
  exposed situation marked -6° F. as the lowest winter temperature: while
  in many parts of Siberia mercury freezes during several weeks in winter,
  showing a temperature below -40° F.; yet here the summers are hot, all
  the snow disappears, and there is a luxuriant vegetation. Even in the
  very highest latitudes reached by our last Arctic Expedition there is
  very little perpetual snow or ice, for Captain Nares tells us that north
  of Haye's Sound, in Lat. 79° N., the mountains were remarkably free from
  ice-cap, while extensive tracts of land were free from snow during
  summer, and covered with a rich vegetation with abundance of bright
  flowers. The reason of this is evidently the scanty snow-fall, which
  rendered it sometimes difficult to obtain enough to form shelter-banks
  around the ships; and this was north of 80° N. Lat., where the sun was
  absent for 142 days.</p>

  <p><i>Perpetual Snow Nowhere Exists on Lowland Areas.</i>&mdash;It is a
  very remarkable and most suggestive fact, that nowhere in the world at
  the present time are there any extensive lowlands covered with perpetual
  snow. The Tundras of Siberia and the barren grounds of N. America are all
  clothed with some kind of summer vegetation;<a name="NtA_47"
  href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> and it is <!-- Page 136 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>{136}</span>only where there are
  lofty mountains or plateaus&mdash;as in Greenland, Spitzbergen, and
  Grinnell's Land&mdash;that glaciers, accompanied by perpetual snow, cover
  the country, and descend in places to the level of the sea. In the
  Antarctic regions there are extensive highlands and lofty mountains, and
  these are everywhere exposed to the influence of moist sea-air; and it is
  here, accordingly, that we find the nearest approach to a true ice-cap
  covering the whole circumference of the Antarctic continent, and forming
  a girdle of ice-cliffs which almost everywhere descend to the sea. Such
  Antarctic islands as South Georgia, South Shetland, and Heard Island, are
  often said to have perpetual snow at sea-level; but they are all very
  mountainous, and send down glaciers into the sea, and as they are exposed
  to moist sea-air on every side, the precipitation, almost all of which
  takes the form of snow even in summer, is of course unusually large.<a
  name="NtA_48" href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

  <p>That high land in an area of great precipitation is the necessary
  condition of glaciation, is well shown by the general state of the two
  polar areas at the present time. The northern part of the north temperate
  zone is almost all land, mostly low but with elevated borders; while the
  polar area is, with the exception of Greenland and a few other
  considerable islands, almost all water. In the southern hemisphere the
  temperate zone is almost all water, while the polar area is almost all
  land, or is at least inclosed by a ring of high and mountainous land. The
  result is that in the north the polar area is free from any accumulation
  of permanent ice (except on the highlands of Greenland and Grinnell's
  Land), while in the south a complete barrier of ice of enormous thickness
  appears to surround the pole. Dr. Croll shows, from the measured height
  of numerous Antarctic icebergs (often miles in length) that the ice-sheet
  from which they are the broken outer fragments must be from a mile to a
  mile and a half <!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page137"></a>{137}</span>in thickness.<a name="NtA_49"
  href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> As this is the thickness of the outer
  edge of the ice it must be far thicker inland; and we thus find that the
  Antarctic continent is at this very time suffering glaciation to quite as
  great an extent as we have reason to believe occurred in the same
  latitudes of the northern hemisphere during the last glacial epoch.</p>

  <p>The accompanying diagrams show the comparative state of the two polar
  areas both as regards the distribution of land and sea, and the extent of
  the ice-sheet and floating icebergs. The much greater quantity of ice at
  the south pole is undoubtedly due to the presence of a large extent of
  high land, which acts as a condenser, and an unbroken surrounding ocean,
  which affords a constant supply of vapour; and the effect is intensified
  by winter being there in <i>aphelion</i>, and thus several days longer
  than with us, while the whole southern hemisphere is at that time farther
  from the sun, and therefore receives less heat.</p>

  <p>We see, however, that with less favourable conditions for the
  production and accumulation of ice, Greenland is glaciated down to Lat.
  61°. What, then, would be the effect if the Antarctic continent, instead
  of being confined almost wholly within the south polar circle, were to
  extend in one or two great mountainous promontories far into the
  temperate zone? The comparatively small Heard Island in S. Lat. 53° is
  even now glaciated down to the sea. What would be its condition were it a
  northerly extension of a lofty Antarctic continent? We may be quite sure
  that glaciation would then be far more severe, and that an ice-sheet
  corresponding to that of Greenland might extend to beyond the parallel of
  50° S. Lat. Even this is probably much too low an estimate, for on the
  west coast of New Zealand in S. Lat. 43° 35&prime; a glacier even now
  descends to within 705 feet of the sea-level; and if those islands were
  the northern extension of an Antarctic continent, we may be pretty sure
  that they would be nearly in the ice-covered condition of Greenland,
  although situated in the latitude of Marseilles.</p>

  <p><i>Conditions Determining the Presence or Absence of Perpetual
  Snow.</i>&mdash;It is clear, then, that the vicinity of a sea or ocean to
  supply moisture, together with high land to serve as a condenser of that
  moisture into snow, are the prime essentials of a great accumulation of
  ice; and it is fully in accordance with this view that we find the most
  undoubted signs of extensive glaciation in the west of Europe and the
  east of North America, both washed by the Atlantic and both having
  abundance of high land to condense the moisture which it supplies.
  Without these conditions cold alone, however great, can produce no
  glacial epoch. This is strikingly shown by the fact, that in the very
  coldest portions of the two northern continents&mdash;Eastern Siberia and
  the north-western shores of Hudson's Bay&mdash;there is no perennial
  covering of snow or ice whatever. No less remarkable is the coincidence
  of the districts of greatest glaciation with those of greatest rainfall
  at the present time. Looking at a rain-map of the British Isles, we see
  that the greatest area of excessive rainfall is the Highlands of
  Scotland, then follows the west of Ireland, Wales, and the north of
  England; and these were glaciated pretty nearly in proportion to the area
  of country over which there is an abundant supply of moisture. So in
  Europe, the Alps and the Scandinavian mountains have excessive rainfall,
  and have been areas of excessive glaciation, while the Ural and Caucasian
  mountains, with less rain, never seem to have been proportionally
  glaciated. In North America the eastern coast has an abundant rainfall,
  and New England with North-eastern Canada seems to have been the source
  of much of the glaciation of that continent.<a name="NtA_50"
  href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>{140}</span></p>

  <p>The reason why no accumulation of snow or ice ever takes place on
  Arctic lowlands is explained by the observations of Lieut. Payer of the
  Austrian Polar Expedition, who found that during the short Arctic summer
  of the highest latitudes the ice-fields diminished four feet in thickness
  under the influence of the sun and wind. To replace this would require a
  precipitation of snow equivalent to about 45 inches of rain, an amount
  which rarely occurs in lowlands out of the tropics. In Siberia, within
  and near the Arctic circle, about six feet of snow covers the country all
  the winter and spring, and is not sensibly diminished by the powerful sun
  so long as northerly winds keep the air below the freezing-point and
  occasional snow-storms occur. But early in June the wind usually changes
  to southerly, probably the south-western anti-trades overcoming the
  northern inflow; and under its influence the snow all disappears in a few
  days and the vegetable kingdom bursts into full luxuriance. This is very
  important as showing the impotence of mere sun-heat to get rid of a thick
  mass of snow so long as the air remains cold, while currents of warm air
  are in the highest degree effective. If, however, they are not of
  sufficiently high temperature or do not last long enough to melt the
  snow, they are likely to increase it, from the quantity of moisture they
  bring with them which will be condensed into snow by coming into contact
  with the frozen surface. We may therefore expect the transition from
  perpetual snow to a luxuriant arctic vegetation to be very abrupt,
  depending as it must on a few degrees more or less in the summer
  temperature of the air; and this is quite in accordance with the fact of
  corn ripening by the sides of alpine glaciers.</p>

  <p><i>Efficiency of Astronomical Causes in Producing
  Glaciation.</i>&mdash;Having now collected a sufficient body of facts,
  let us endeavour to ascertain what would be the state to which the
  northern hemisphere would be reduced by a <!-- Page 141 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>{141}</span>high degree of
  excentricity and a winter in <i>aphelion</i>. When the glacial epoch is
  supposed to have been at its maximum, about 210,000 years ago, the
  excentricity was more than three times as great as it is now, and,
  according to Dr. Croll's calculations, the mid-winter temperature of the
  northern hemisphere would have been lowered 36° F., while the winter half
  of the year would have been twenty-six days longer than the summer half.
  This would bring the January mean temperature of England and Scotland
  almost down to zero or about 30° F. of frost, a winter climate
  corresponding to that of Labrador, or the coast of Greenland on the
  Arctic circle. But we must remember that the summer would be very much
  hotter than it is now, and the problem to be solved is, whether,
  supposing the geography of the northern hemisphere to have been identical
  with what it is now, the snow that fell in winter would accumulate to
  such an extent that it would not be melted in summer, and so go on
  increasing year by year till it covered the whole of Scotland, Ireland,
  and Wales, and much of England. Dr. Croll and Dr. Geikie answer that it
  would. Sir Charles Lyell maintained that it would only do so if
  geographical conditions were then more favourable than they are now;
  while the late Mr. Belt has argued, that excentricity alone would not
  produce the effect unless aided by increased obliquity of the ecliptic,
  which, by extending the width of the polar regions, would increase the
  duration and severity of the winter to such an extent that snow and ice
  would be formed in the Arctic and Antarctic regions at the same time
  whether the winter were in <i>perihelion</i> or <i>aphelion</i>.<a
  name="NtA_51" href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The problem we have now to solve is a very difficult one, because we
  have no case at all parallel to it from which we can draw direct
  conclusions. It is, however, clear from the various considerations we
  have already adduced, that the increased cold of winter when the
  excentricity was great and the sun in <i>aphelion</i> during that season,
  would not of itself produce a glacial epoch unless the amount of <!--
  Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page142"></a>{142}</span>vapour supplied for condensation was also
  exceptionally great. The greatest quantity of snow falls in the Arctic
  regions in summer and autumn, and with us the greatest quantity of rain
  falls in the autumnal months. It seems probable, then, that in all
  northern lands glaciation would commence when autumn occurred in
  <i>aphelion</i>. All the rain which falls on our mountains at that season
  would then fall as snow, and, being further increased by the snow of
  winter, would form accumulations which the summer might not be able to
  melt. As time went on, and the <i>aphelion</i> occurred in winter, the
  perennial snow on the mountains would have accumulated to such an extent
  as to chill the spring and summer vapours, so that they too would fall as
  snow, and thus increase the amount of deposition; but it is probable that
  this would never in our latitudes have been sufficient to produce
  glaciation, were it not for a series of climatal reactions which tend
  still further to increase the production of snow.</p>

  <p><i>Action of Meteorological Causes in intensifying
  Glaciation.</i>&mdash;The trade-winds owe their existence to the great
  difference between the temperature of the equator and the poles, which
  causes a constant flow of air towards the equator. The strength of this
  flow depends on the difference of temperature and the extent of the
  cooled and heated masses of air, and this effect is now greatest between
  the south pole and the equator, owing to the much greater accumulation of
  ice in the Antarctic regions. The consequence is, that the south-east
  trades are stronger than the north-east, the neutral zone or belt of
  calms between them not being on the equator but several degrees to the
  north of it. But just in proportion to the strength of the trade-winds is
  the strength of the anti-trades, that is, the upper return current which
  carries the warm moisture-laden air of the tropics towards the poles,
  descending in the temperate zone as west and south-west winds. These are
  now strongest in the southern hemisphere, and, passing everywhere over a
  wide ocean, they supply the moisture necessary to produce the enormous
  quantity of snow which falls in the Antarctic area. During the period we
  are now discussing, however, this state of things would have been <!--
  Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page143"></a>{143}</span>partially reversed. The south polar area,
  having its winter in <i>perihelion</i>, would probably have had less ice,
  while the north-temperate and Arctic regions would have been largely
  ice-clad; and the north-east trades would therefore be stronger than they
  are now. The south-westerly anti-trades would also be stronger in the
  same proportion, and would bring with them a greatly increased quantity
  of moisture, which is the prime necessity to produce a condition of
  glaciation.</p>

  <p>But this is only one-half of the effect that would be produced, for
  the increased force of the trades sets up another action which still
  further helps on the accumulation of snow and ice. It is now generally
  admitted that we owe much of our mild climate and our comparative freedom
  from snow to the influence of the Gulf Stream, which also ameliorates the
  climate of Scandinavia and Spitzbergen, as shown by the remarkable
  northward curvature of the isothermal lines, so that Drontheim in N. Lat.
  62° has the same mean temperature as Halifax (Nova Scotia) in N. Lat.
  45°. The quantity of heat now brought into the North Atlantic by the Gulf
  Stream depends mainly on the superior strength of the south-east trades.
  When the north-east trades were the more powerful, the Gulf Stream would
  certainly be of much less magnitude and velocity; while it is possible,
  as Dr. Croll thinks, that a large portion of it might be diverted
  southward owing to the peculiar form of the east coast of South America,
  and so go to swell the Brazilian current and ameliorate the climate of
  the southern hemisphere.</p>

  <p>That effects of this nature would follow from any increase of the
  Arctic, and decrease of the Antarctic ice, may be considered certain; and
  Dr. Croll has clearly shown that in this case cause and effect act and
  react on each other in a remarkable way. The increase of snow and ice in
  the northern hemisphere is the cause of an increased supply of moisture
  being brought by the more powerful anti-trades, and this greater supply
  of moisture leads to an extension of the ice, which reacts in still
  further increasing the supply of moisture. The same increase of snow and
  ice, by causing the north-east to be stronger than the south-east <!--
  Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page144"></a>{144}</span>trade-winds, diminishes the force of the
  Gulf Stream, and this diminution lowers the temperature of the North
  Atlantic both in summer and winter, and thus helps on still further the
  formation and perpetuation of the icy mantle. It must also be remembered
  that these agencies are at the same time acting in a reverse way in the
  southern hemisphere, diminishing the supply of the moisture carried by
  the anti-trades, and increasing the temperature by means of more powerful
  southward ocean-currents;&mdash;and all this again reacts on the northern
  hemisphere, increasing yet further the supply of moisture by the more
  powerful south-westerly winds, while still further lowering the
  temperature by the southward diversion of the Gulf Stream.</p>

  <p><i>Summary of Principal Causes of Glaciation.</i>&mdash;I have now
  sufficiently answered the question, why the short hot summer would not
  melt the snow which accumulated during the long cold winter (produced by
  high excentricity and winter in <i>aphelion</i>), although the annual
  amount of heat received from the sun was exactly the same as it is now,
  and equal in the two hemispheres. It may be well, before going further,
  briefly to summarise the essential causes of this apparent paradox. These
  are&mdash;primarily, the fact that solar heat cannot be stored up owing
  to its being continually carried away by air and water, while cold can be
  so stored up owing to the comparative immobility of snow and ice; and, in
  the second place, because the two great heat-distributing agencies, the
  winds and the ocean-currents, are so affected by an increase of the snow
  and ice towards one pole and its diminution towards the other, as to help
  on the process when it has once begun, and by their action and reaction
  produce a maximum of effect which, without their aid, would be altogether
  unattainable.</p>

  <p>But even this does not exhaust the causes at work, all tending in one
  direction. Snow and ice reflect heat to a much greater degree than do
  land or water. The heat, therefore, of the short summer would have far
  less effect than is due to its calculated amount in melting the snow,
  because so much of it would be lost by reflection. A <!-- Page 145
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>{145}</span>portion of the
  reflected heat would no doubt warm the vapour in the atmosphere, but this
  heat would be carried off to other parts of the earth, while a
  considerable portion of the whole would be lost in space. It must also be
  remembered that an enormous quantity of heat is used up in melting snow
  and ice, without raising its temperature; each cubic foot of ice
  requiring as much heat to melt it as would raise nearly six cubic feet of
  water 30° F. It has, however, been argued that because when water is
  frozen it evolves just as much heat as it requires to melt it again,
  there is no loss of heat on the whole; and as this is adduced over and
  over again as a valid argument in every criticism of Dr. Croll's theory,
  it may be well to consider it a little more closely. In the act of
  freezing no doubt water gives up some of its heat to the surrounding air;
  but <i>that air still remains below the freezing point</i> or freezing
  would not take place. The heat liberated by freezing is, therefore, what
  may be termed low-grade heat&mdash;heat incapable of melting snow or ice;
  while the heat absorbed while ice or snow is melting is high-grade heat,
  such as is capable of melting snow and supporting vegetable growth.
  Moreover, the low-grade heat liberated in the formation of snow is
  usually liberated high up in the atmosphere, where it may be carried off
  by winds to more southern latitudes, while the heat absorbed in melting
  the surface of snow and ice is absorbed close to the earth and is thus
  prevented from warming the lower atmosphere, which is in contact with
  vegetation. The two phenomena, therefore, by no means counterbalance or
  counteract each other, as it is so constantly and superficially asserted
  that they do.</p>

  <p><i>Effect of Clouds and Fog in cutting off the Sun's
  Heat.</i>&mdash;Another very important cause of diminution of heat during
  summer in a glaciated country would be the intervention of clouds and
  fogs, which would reflect or absorb a large proportion of the sun-heat
  and prevent it reaching the surface of the earth; and such a cloudy
  atmosphere would be a necessary result of large areas of high land
  covered with snow and ice. That such a prevalence of fogs and cloud is an
  actual fact in all ice-clad countries has been shown by Dr. Croll most
  conclusively, and he has further <!-- Page 146 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>{146}</span>shown that the
  existence of perpetual snow often depends upon it. South Georgia in the
  latitude of Yorkshire is almost, and Sandwich Land in the latitude of the
  north of Scotland, is entirely covered with perpetual snow; yet in their
  summer the sun is three million miles nearer the earth than it is in our
  summer, and the heat actually received from the sun must be sufficient to
  raise the temperature 20° F. higher than in the same latitudes in the
  northern hemisphere, were the conditions equal&mdash;instead of which
  their summer temperature is probably full 20° lower. The chief cause of
  this can only be that the heat of the sun does not reach the surface of
  the earth; and that this is the fact is testified by all Antarctic
  voyagers. Darwin notes the cloudy sky and constant moisture of the
  southern part of Chile, and in his remarks on the climate and productions
  of the Antarctic islands he says: "In the Southern Ocean the winter is
  not so excessively cold, but the summer is far less hot (than in the
  north), <i>for the clouded sky seldom allows the sun to warm the
  ocean</i>, itself a bad absorbent of heat; and hence the mean temperature
  of the year, which regulates the zone of perpetually congealed
  under-soil, is low." Sir James Ross, Lieutenant Wilkes, and other
  Antarctic voyagers speak of the snow-storms, the absence of sunshine, and
  the freezing temperature in the height of summer; and Dr. Croll shows
  that this is a constant phenomenon accompanying the presence of large
  masses of ice in every part of the world.<a name="NtA_52"
  href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In reply to the objections of a recent critic Dr. Croll has given a
  new proof of this important fact by comparing the known amount of
  snow-fall with the equally well-known melting power of direct sun-heat in
  different latitudes. He says: "The annual precipitation on Greenland in
  the form of snow and rain, according to Dr. Rink, amounts to only twelve
  inches, and two inches of this he considers is never melted, but is
  carried away in the form of icebergs. The quantity of heat received at
  the <!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page147"></a>{147}</span>equator from sunrise to sunset, if none
  were cut off by the atmosphere, would melt 3&#x2153; inches of ice, or
  100 feet in a year. The quantity received between latitude 60° and 80°,
  which is that of Greenland, is, according to Meech, one-half that
  received at the equator. The heat received by Greenland from the sun, if
  none were cut off by the atmosphere, would therefore melt fifty feet of
  ice per annum, or fifty times the amount of snow which falls on that
  continent. What then cuts off the ninety-eight per cent of the sun's
  heat?" The only possible answer is, that it is the clouds and fog during
  a great part of the summer, and reflection from the surface of the snow
  and ice when these are absent.</p>

  <p><i>South Temperate America as Illustrating the Influence of
  Astronomical Causes on Climate.</i>&mdash;Those persons who still doubt
  the effect of winter in <i>aphelion</i> with a high degree of
  excentricity in producing glaciation, should consider how the condition
  of south temperate America at the present day is explicable if they
  reject this agency. The line of perpetual snow in the Southern Andes is
  so low as 6,000 feet in the same latitude as the Pyrenees; in the
  latitude of the Swiss Alps mountains only 6,200 feet high produce immense
  glaciers which descend to the sea-level; while in the latitude of
  Cumberland mountains only from 3,000 to 4,000 feet high have every valley
  filled with streams of ice descending to the sea-coast and giving off
  abundance of huge icebergs.<a name="NtA_53"
  href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> Here we have exactly the condition of
  things to which England and Western Europe were subjected during the
  latter portion of the glacial epoch, when every valley in Wales,
  Cumberland, and Scotland had its glacier; and to what can this state of
  things be imputed if not to the fact that there is now a moderate amount
  of excentricity, and the winter of the southern hemisphere is in
  <i>aphelion</i>? The mere geographical position of the southern extremity
  of America does not seem especially favourable to the production of such
  a state of glaciation. The land narrows from the tropics southwards and
  terminates altogether in about the latitude of Edinburgh; the <!-- Page
  148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>{148}</span>mountains
  are of moderate height; while during summer the sun is three millions of
  miles nearer, and the heat received from it is equivalent to a rise of
  20° F. as compared with the same season in the northern hemisphere. The
  only important differences are: the open southern ocean, the longer and
  colder winter, and the general low temperature caused by the south polar
  ice. But the great accumulation of south polar ice is itself due to the
  great extent of high land within the Antarctic circle acted upon by the
  long cold winter and furnished with moisture by the surrounding wide
  ocean. These conditions of high land and open ocean we know did not
  prevail to so great an extent in the northern hemisphere during the
  glacial epoch, as they do in the southern hemisphere at the present time;
  but the other acting cause&mdash;the long cold winter&mdash;existed in a
  far higher degree, owing to the excentricity being about three times as
  much as it is now. It is, so far as we know or are justified in
  believing, the <i>only</i> efficient cause of glaciation which was
  undoubtedly much more powerful at that time; and we are therefore
  compelled to accept it as the most probable cause of the much greater
  glaciation which then prevailed.</p>

  <p><i>Geographical Changes, how far a Cause of
  Glaciation.</i>&mdash;Messrs. Croll and Geikie have both objected to the
  views of Sir Charles Lyell as to the preponderating influence of the
  distribution of land and sea on climate; and they maintain that if the
  land were accumulated almost wholly in the equatorial regions, the
  temperature of the earth's surface as a whole would be lowered, not
  raised, as Sir Charles Lyell maintained. The reason given is, that the
  land being heated heats the air, which rises and thus gives off much of
  the heat to space, while the same area covered with water would retain
  more of the heat, and by means of currents carry it to other parts of the
  earth's surface. But although the mean temperature of the whole earth
  might be somewhat lowered by such a disposition of the land, there can be
  little doubt that it would render all extremes of temperature impossible,
  and that even during a period of high excentricity there would be no
  glacial epochs, and perhaps no such thing as ice anywhere produced. This
  <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page149"></a>{149}</span>would result from there being no land near
  the poles to retain snow, while the constant interchange of water by
  means of currents between the polar and tropical regions would most
  likely prevent ice from ever forming in the sea. On the other hand, were
  all the land accumulated in the polar and temperate regions there can be
  little doubt that a state of almost perpetual glaciation of much of the
  land would result, notwithstanding that the whole earth should <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `thoretically'."
  >theoretically</span> be at a somewhat higher temperature. Two main
  causes would bring about this glaciation. A very large area of elevated
  land in high latitudes would act as a powerful condenser of the enormous
  quantity of vapour produced by the whole of the equatorial and much of
  the temperate regions being areas of evaporation, and thus a greater
  accumulation of snow and ice would take place around both poles than
  would be possible under any other conditions. In the second place there
  would be little or no check to this accumulation of ice, because, owing
  to the quantity of land around the polar areas, warm oceanic currents
  could not reach them, while the warm winds would necessarily bring so
  much moisture that they would help on instead of checking the process of
  ice-accumulation. If we suppose the continents to be of the same total
  area and to have the same extent and altitude of mountain ranges as the
  present ones, these mountains must necessarily offer an almost continuous
  barrier to the vapour-bearing winds from the south, and the result would
  probably be that three-fourths of the land would be in the ice-clad
  condition of Greenland, while a comparatively narrow belt of the more
  southern lowlands would alone afford habitable surfaces or produce any
  woody vegetation.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding, therefore, the criticism above referred to, I believe
  that Sir Charles Lyell was substantially right, and that the two ideal
  maps given in the <i>Principles of Geology</i> (11th ed. Vol. i. p. 270),
  if somewhat modified so as to allow a freer passage of currents in the
  tropics, do really exhibit a condition of the earth which, by
  geographical changes alone, would bring about a perpetual summer or an
  almost universal winter. But we have seen in our sixth chapter that there
  is the strongest cumulative evidence, <!-- Page 150 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page150"></a>{150}</span>almost amounting to
  demonstration, that for all known geological periods our continents and
  oceans have occupied the same general position they do now, and that no
  such radical changes in the distribution of sea and land as imagined by
  way of hypothesis by Sir Charles Lyell, have ever occurred. Such an
  hypothesis, however, is not without its use in our present inquiry, for
  if we obtain thereby a clear conception of the influence of such great
  changes on climate, we are the better able to appreciate the tendency of
  lesser changes such as have undoubtedly often occurred.</p>

  <p><i>Land as a Barrier to Ocean Currents.</i>&mdash;We have seen already
  the great importance of elevated land to serve as condensers and
  ice-accumulators; but there is another and hardly less important effect
  that may be produced by an extension of land in high latitudes, which is,
  to act as a barrier to the flow of ocean currents. In the region with
  which we are more immediately interested it is easy to see how a
  comparatively slight alteration of land and sea, such as has undoubtedly
  occurred, would produce an enormous effect on climate. Let us suppose,
  for instance, that the British Isles again became continental, and that
  this continental land extended across the Färoe Islands and Iceland to
  Greenland. The whole of the warm waters of the Atlantic, with the Gulf
  Stream, would then be shut out from Northern Europe, and the result would
  almost certainly be that snow would accumulate on the high mountains of
  Scandinavia till they became glaciated to as great an extent as
  Greenland, and the cold thus produced would react on our own country and
  cover the Grampians with perpetual snow, like mountains of the same
  height at even a lower latitude in South America.</p>

  <p>If a similar change were to occur on the opposite side of the Atlantic
  very different effects would be produced. Suppose, for instance, the east
  side of Greenland were to sink considerably, while on the west the sea
  bottom were to rise in Davis' Strait so as to unite Greenland with
  Baffin's Land, thus stopping altogether the cold Arctic current with its
  enormous stream of icebergs from the west coast of Greenland. Such a
  change might cause a great accumulation of ice in the higher polar
  latitudes, but it <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page151"></a>{151}</span>would certainly produce a wonderful
  ameliorating effect on the climate of the east coast of North America,
  and might raise the temperature of Labrador to that of Scotland. Now
  these two changes have almost certainly occurred, either together or
  separately, during the Tertiary period, and they must have had a
  considerable effect either in aiding or checking the action of the
  terrestrial and astronomical causes affecting climate which were then in
  operation.</p>

  <p>It would be easy to suggest other probable changes which would produce
  a marked effect on climate; but we will only refer to the subsidence of
  the Isthmus of Panama, which has certainly happened more than once in
  Tertiary times. If this subsidence were considerable it would have
  allowed much of the accumulated warm water which initiates the Gulf
  Stream to pass into the Pacific; and if this occurred while astronomical
  causes were tending to bring about a cold period in the northern
  hemisphere, the resulting glaciation might be exceptionally severe. The
  effect of this change would however be neutralised if at the same epoch
  the Lesser and Greater Antilles formed a connected land.</p>

  <p>Now, as such possible and even probable geographical changes are very
  numerous, they must have produced important effects; and though we may
  admit that the astronomical causes already explained were the most
  important in determining the last glacial epoch, we must also allow that
  geographical changes must often have had an equally important and perhaps
  even a preponderating influence on climate. We must also remember that
  changes of land and sea are almost always accompanied by elevation or
  depression of the pre-existing land: and whereas the former produces its
  chief effect by diverting the course of warm or cold oceanic currents,
  the latter is of not less importance in adding to or diminishing those
  areas of condensation and ice-accumulation which, as we have seen, are
  the most efficient agents in producing glaciation.</p>

  <p>If then Sir Charles Lyell may have somewhat erred in attaching too
  exclusive an importance to geographical changes as bringing about
  mutations of climate, his critics <!-- Page 152 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page152"></a>{152}</span>have, I think, attached
  far too little importance to these changes. We know that they have always
  been in progress to a sufficient extent to produce important climatal
  effects; and we shall probably be nearest the truth if we consider, that
  great extremes of cold have only occurred when astronomical and
  geographical causes were acting in the same direction and thus produced a
  cumulative result, while, through the agency of warm oceanic currents,
  the latter alone have been the chief cause of mild climates in high
  latitudes, as we shall attempt to prove in our next chapter.<a
  name="NtA_54" href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>On the Theory of Inter-glacial Periods and their Probable
  Character.</i>&mdash;The theory by which the glacial epoch is here
  explained is one which apparently necessitates repeated changes from
  glacial to warm periods, with all the consequences and modifications both
  of climate and physical geography which follow or accompany such changes.
  It is essentially a theory of alternation; and it is certainly <!-- Page
  153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>{153}</span>remarkable
  in how many cases geologists have independently deduced some alternations
  of climate as probable. Such are the interglacial deposits indicating a
  mild climate, both in Europe and America; an early phase of very severe
  glaciation when the "till" was deposited, with later less extensive
  glaciation when moraines were left in the valleys; several successive
  periods of submergence and elevation, the later ones becoming less and
  less in amount, as indicated by the raised beaches slightly elevated
  above our present coast line; and lastly, the occurrence in the same
  deposits of animal remains indicating both a warm and a cold climate, and
  especially the existence of the hippopotamus in Yorkshire not long after
  the period of extreme glaciation.</p>

  <p>But although the evidence of <i>some</i> alternations of climate seems
  indisputable, and no suggestion of any adequate cause for them other than
  the alternating phases of precession during high excentricity has been
  made, it by no means follows that these changes were always very
  great&mdash;that is to say, that the ice completely disappeared and a
  warm climate prevailed throughout the whole year. It is quite evident
  that during the height of the glacial epoch there was a combination of
  causes at work which led to a large portion of North-western Europe and
  Eastern America being buried in ice to a greater extent even than
  Greenland is now, since it certainly extended beyond the land and filled
  up all the shallow seas between our islands and Scandinavia. Among these
  causes we must reckon a diminution of the force of the Gulf Stream, or
  its being diverted from the north-western coasts of Europe; and what we
  have to consider is, whether the alteration from a long cold winter and
  short hot summer to a short mild winter and long cool summer would
  greatly affect the amount of ice <i>if the ocean currents remained the
  same</i>. The force of these currents is, it is true, by our hypothesis,
  modified by the increase or diminution of the ice in the two hemispheres
  alternately, and they then react upon climate; but they cannot be thus
  changed till <i>after</i> the ice-accumulation has been considerably
  affected by other causes. Their direction may, indeed, be greatly <!--
  Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page154"></a>{154}</span>changed by slight alterations in the
  outline of the land, while they may be barred out altogether by other
  alterations of not very great amount; but such changes as these have no
  relation to the alteration of climates caused by the changing phases of
  precession.</p>

  <p>Now, the existence at the present time of an ice-clad Greenland is an
  anomaly in the northern hemisphere, only to be explained by the fact that
  cold currents from the polar area flow down both sides of it. In Eastern
  Asia we have the lofty Stanivoi Mountains in the same latitude as the
  southern part of Greenland, which, though their summits are covered with
  perpetual snow, give rise to no ice-sheet, and, apparently, even to no
  important glaciers;&mdash;a fact undoubtedly connected with the warm
  Japan current flowing partially into the Sea of Okhotsk. So in North-west
  America we have the lofty coast range, culminating in Mt. St. Elias,
  nearly 15,000 feet high, and an extensive tract of high land to the north
  and north-west, with glaciers comparable in size with those of New
  Zealand, although situated in Lat. 60° instead of in Lat. 45°. Here, too,
  we have the main body of the Japan current turning east and south, and
  thus producing a mild climate, little inferior to that of Norway, warmed
  by the Gulf Stream. We thus have it made clear that could the two Arctic
  currents be diverted from Greenland, that country would become free from
  ice, and might even be completely forest-clad and inhabitable; while, if
  the Japan current were to be diverted from the coast of North America and
  a cold current come out of Behring's Strait, the entire northwestern
  extremity of America would even now become buried in ice.</p>

  <p>Now it is the opinion of the best American geologists that during the
  height of the glacial epoch North-eastern America was considerably
  elevated.<a name="NtA_55" href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> This
  elevation would bring the wide area of the banks of Newfoundland far
  above water, causing the American coast to stretch out in an immense
  curve to a point more than 600 miles east of Halifax; and this would
  certainly divert much of the greatly reduced Gulf Stream straight across
  to the coast of <!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page155"></a>{155}</span>Spain. The consequence of such a state of
  things would probably be that the southward flowing Arctic currents would
  be much reduced in velocity; and the enormous quantity of icebergs
  continually produced by the ice-sheets of all the lands bordering the
  North Atlantic would hang about their shores and the adjacent seas,
  filling them with a dense ice-pack, equalling that of the Antarctic
  regions, and chilling the atmosphere so as to produce constant clouds and
  fog with almost perpetual snowstorms, even at midsummer, such as now
  prevail in the worst portions of the Southern Ocean.</p>

  <p>But when such was the state of the North Atlantic (and, however
  caused, such <i>must</i> have been its state during the height of the
  glacial epoch), can we suppose that the mere change from the distant sun
  in winter and near sun in summer, to the reverse, could bring about any
  important alteration&mdash;<i>the physical and geographical causes of
  glaciation remaining unchanged</i>? For, certainly, the less powerful sun
  of summer, even though lasting somewhat longer, could not do more than
  the much more powerful sun did during the phase of summer in
  <i>perihelion</i>, while during the less severe winters the sun would
  have far less power than when it was equally near and at a very much
  greater altitude in summer. It seems to me, therefore, quite certain that
  whenever <i>extreme</i> glaciation has been brought about by high
  excentricity combined with favourable geographical and physical causes
  (and without this combination it is doubtful whether <i>extreme</i>
  glaciation would ever occur), then the ice-sheet will <i>not</i> be
  removed during the alternate phases of precession, so long as these
  geographical and physical causes remain unaltered. It is true that the
  warm and cold oceanic currents, which are the most important agents in
  increasing or diminishing glaciation, depend for their strength and
  efficiency upon the comparative extents of the northern and southern
  ice-sheets; but these ice-sheets cannot, I believe, increase or diminish
  to any important extent unless some geographical or physical change first
  occurs.<a name="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>{156}</span></p>

  <p>If this argument is valid, then it would follow that, so long as
  excentricity was high, whatever condition of climate was brought about by
  it in combination with geographical causes, would persist through several
  phases of precession; but this would not necessarily be the case when the
  excentricity itself changed, and became more moderate. It would then
  depend upon the proportionate effect of climatal and geographical causes
  in producing glaciation as to what change would be produced by the
  changing phases of precession; and we can best examine this question by
  considering the probable effect of the change in precession during the
  next period of 10,500 years, with the present moderate degree of
  excentricity.</p>

  <p><i>Probable Effect of Winter in Aphelion on the Climate of
  Britain.</i>&mdash;Let us then suppose the winters of the northern
  hemisphere to become longer and much colder, the <!-- Page 157 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>{157}</span>summers being
  proportionately shorter and hotter, without any other change whatever.
  The long cold winter would certainly bring down the snow-line
  considerably, covering large areas of high land with snow during the
  winter months, and causing all glaciers and ice-fields to become larger.
  This would chill the superincumbent atmosphere to such an extent that the
  warm sun and winds of spring and early summer would bring clouds and fog,
  so that the sun-heat would be cut off and much vapour be condensed as
  snow. The greater sun-heat of summer would no doubt considerably reduce
  the snow and ice; but it is, I think, quite certain that the extra
  accumulation would not be all melted, and that therefore the snow-line
  would be permanently lowered. This would be a necessary result, because
  the greater part of the increased cold of winter would be stored up in
  snow and ice, while the increased heat of summer could not be in any way
  stored up, but would be largely prevented from producing any effect, by
  reflection from the surface of the snow and by the intervention of clouds
  and fog which would carry much of the heat they received to other
  regions. It follows that 10,000 years hence, when our winter will occur
  in <i>aphelion</i> (instead of, as now, in <i>perihelion</i>), there will
  be produced a colder climate, independently of any change of land and
  sea, of heights of mountains, or in the force of oceanic currents.</p>

  <p>But if this is true, then the reverse change, bringing the sun back
  into exactly the same position with regard to us as it is in now (all
  geographical and physical conditions remaining unchanged), would
  certainly bring back again our present milder climate. The change either
  way would not probably be very great, but it might be sufficient to bring
  the snow-line down to 3,000 feet in Scotland, so that all the higher
  mountains would have their tops covered with perpetual snow. This
  perpetual snow, down to a fixed line, would be kept up by the needful
  supply of snow falling during autumn, winter, and spring, and this would,
  as we have seen, depend mainly on the increased length and greatly
  increased cold of the winter. As both the duration and the cold of winter
  decreased the amount of snow would certainly decrease, and of this lesser
  quantity of snow <!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page158"></a>{158}</span>a larger proportion would be melted by the
  longer, though somewhat cooler summer. This would follow because the
  total amount of sun-heat received during the summer would be the same as
  before, while it would act on a less quantity of snow; there would thus
  be a smaller surface to reflect the heat, and a smaller condensing area
  to produce fogs, while the diminished intensity of the sun would produce
  a less dense canopy of clouds, which have been shown to be of prime
  importance in checking the melting of snow by the sun. We have considered
  this case, for simplicity of reasoning, on the supposition that all
  geographical and physical causes remained unchanged. But if an alteration
  of the climate of the whole north temperate and Arctic zones occurred, as
  here indicated, this would certainly affect both the winds and currents,
  in the manner already explained (<i>see</i> p. <a
  href="#page142">142</a>), so as to react upon climate and increase the
  differences produced by phases of precession. How far that effect would
  be again increased by corresponding but opposite changes in the southern
  hemisphere it is impossible to say. It may be that existing geographical
  and physical conditions are there such potent agents in producing a state
  of glaciation that no change in the phases of precession would materially
  affect it. Still, as the climate of the whole southern hemisphere is
  dominated by the great mass of ice within the Antarctic circle, it seems
  probable that if the winter were shorter and the summer longer the
  quantity of ice would slightly diminish; and this would again react on
  the northern climate as already fully explained.</p>

  <p><i>The Essential Principle of Climatal Change Restated.</i>&mdash;The
  preceding discussion has been somewhat lengthy, owing to the varied
  nature of the facts and arguments adduced, and the extreme complexity of
  the subject. But if, as I venture to urge, the principle here laid down
  is a sound one, it will be of the greatest assistance in clearing away
  some of the many difficulties that beset the whole question of geological
  climates. This principle is, briefly, that the great features of climate
  are determined by a combination of causes, of which geographical
  conditions and the degree of excentricity of the earth's orbit are by
  <!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page159"></a>{159}</span>far the most important; that, when these
  combine to produce a severe glacial epoch, the changing phases of
  precession every 10,500 years have very little, if any, effect on the
  character of the climate, as mild or glacial, though it may modify the
  seasons; but when the excentricity becomes moderate and the resulting
  glaciation less severe, then the changing phases of precession bring
  about a considerable alteration, and even a partial reversal of the
  glacial conditions.</p>

  <p>The reason of this may perhaps be made clearer by considering the
  stability of either extreme glacial conditions or the entire absence of
  perpetual ice and snow, and the comparative instability of an
  intermediate state of climate. When a country is largely covered with
  ice, we may look upon it as possessing the accumulated or stored-up cold
  of a long series of preceding winters; and however much heat is poured
  upon it, its temperature cannot be raised above the freezing point till
  that store of cold is got rid of&mdash;that is, till the ice is all
  melted. But the ice itself, when extensive, tends to its own
  preservation, even under the influence of heat; for the chilled
  atmosphere becomes filled with fog, and this keeps off the sun-heat, and
  then snow falls even during summer, and the stored-up cold does not
  diminish during the year. When, however, only a small portion of the
  surface is covered with ice, the exposed earth becomes heated by the hot
  sun, this warms the air, and the warm air melts the adjacent ice. It
  follows, that towards the equatorial limits of a glaciated country
  alternations of climate may occur during a period of high excentricity,
  while nearer the pole, where the surface is almost completely ice-clad,
  no amelioration may take place. The same argument will, to some extent
  apply, inversely, with mild Arctic climates; but this is a subject which
  will be discussed in the next chapter.</p>

  <p>This view of the character of the last glacial epoch appears to
  correspond very closely with the facts adduced by geologists. The
  inter-glacial deposits never exhibit any indication of a climate whose
  warmth corresponded to the severity of the preceding cold, but rather of
  a partial amelioration of that cold; while it is only the very latest
  <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page160"></a>{160}</span>of them, which we may suppose to have
  occurred when the excentricity was considerably diminished, that exhibit
  any indications of a climate at all warmer than that which now
  prevails.<a name="NtA_57" href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Probable Date of the Glacial Epoch.</i>&mdash;The state of extreme
  glaciation in the northern hemisphere, of which we gave a general
  description at the commencement of the preceding chapter, is a fact of
  which there can be no doubt whatever, and it occurred at a period so
  recent geologically that all the mollusca were the same as species still
  living. There is clear geological proof, however, that considerable
  changes of sea and land, and a large amount of valley denudation, took
  place during and since the glacial epoch, <!-- Page 161 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>{161}</span>while on the other hand
  the surface markings produced by the ice have been extensively preserved;
  and taking all these facts into consideration, the period of about
  200,000 years since it reached its maximum, and about 80,000 years since
  it passed away, is generally considered by geologists to be ample. There
  seems, therefore, to be little doubt that in increased excentricity we
  have found one of the chief exciting causes of the glacial epoch, and
  that we are therefore able to fix its date with a considerable
  probability of being correct. The enormous duration of the glacial epoch
  itself (including its interglacial mild or warm phases), as compared with
  the lapse of time since it finally passed away, is a consideration of the
  greatest importance, and has not yet been taken fully into account in the
  interpretation given by geologists of the physical and biological changes
  that were coincident with, and probably dependent on, it.</p>

  <p><i>Changes of the Sea-level Dependent on Glaciation.</i>&mdash;It has
  been pointed out by Dr. Croll, that many of the changes of level of sea
  and land which occurred about the time of the glacial epoch may be due to
  an alteration of the sea-level caused by a shifting of the earth's centre
  of gravity; and physicists have generally admitted that the cause is a
  real one, and must have produced some effect of the kind indicated. It is
  evident that if ice-sheets several miles in thickness were removed from
  one polar area and placed on the other, the centre of gravity of the
  earth would shift towards the heavier pole, and the sea would necessarily
  follow it, and would rise accordingly. Extreme glacialists have
  maintained that during the height of the glacial epoch, an ice-cap
  extended from about 50° N. Lat. in Europe, and 40° N. Lat. in America,
  continually increasing in thickness, till it reached at least six miles
  thick at the pole; but this view is now generally given up. A similar
  ice-cap is however believed to exist on the Antarctic pole at the present
  day, and its transference to the northern hemisphere would, it is
  calculated, produce a rise of the ocean to the extent of 800 or 1,000
  feet. We have, however, shown that the production of any such ice-cap is
  improbable if not impossible, because snow and ice can <!-- Page 162
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"></a>{162}</span>only
  accumulate where precipitation is greater than melting and evaporation,
  and this is never the case except in areas exposed to the full influence
  of the vapour-bearing winds. The outer rim of the ice-sheet would
  inevitably exhaust the air of so much of its moisture that what reached
  the inner parts would produce far less snow than would be melted by the
  long hot days of summer.<a name="NtA_58"
  href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> The accumulations of ice were therefore
  probably confined, in the northern hemisphere, to the coasts exposed to
  moist winds, and where elevated land and mountain ranges afforded
  condensers to initiate the process of glaciation; and we have already
  seen that the evidence strongly supports this view. Even with this
  limitation, however, the mass of accumulated ice would be enormous, as
  indeed we have positive evidence that it was, and might have caused a
  sufficient shifting of the centre of gravity of the earth to produce a
  submergence of about 150 or 200 feet.</p>

  <p>But this would only be the case if the accumulation of ice on one pole
  was accompanied by a diminution on the other, and this may have occurred
  to a limited extent during the earlier stages of the glacial epoch, when
  alternations of warmer and colder periods would be caused by winter
  occurring in <i>perihelion</i> or <i>aphelion</i>. If, however, as is
  here maintained, no such alternations occurred when the excentricity was
  near its maximum, then the ice would accumulate in the southern
  hemisphere at the same time as in the northern, unless changed
  geographical conditions, of which we have no evidence whatever, prevented
  such accumulations. That there was such a greater accumulation of ice is
  shown by the traces of ancient glaciers in the Southern Andes and in New
  Zealand, and also, according to several writers, in South Africa; and the
  indications in all these localities point to a period so recent that it
  must almost certainly have been contemporaneous with the glacial period
  of the northern hemisphere.<a name="NtA_59"
  href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> <!-- Page 163 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>{163}</span>This greater
  accumulation of ice in both hemispheres would lower the whole ocean by
  the quantity of water <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page164"></a>{164}</span>abstracted from it, while any want of
  perfect synchronism between the decrease of the ice at the two poles
  would cause a movement of the centre of gravity of the earth, and a
  slight rise of the sea-level at one pole and depression at the other. It
  is also generally believed that a great accumulation of ice would cause
  subsidence by its pressure on the flexible crust of the earth, and we
  thus have a very complex series of agents leading to elevations and
  subsidences of limited amount, such as seem always to have accompanied
  glaciation. This complexity of the causes at work may explain the
  somewhat contradictory evidence as to rise and fall of land, some authors
  maintaining that it stood higher, and others lower, during the glacial
  period.</p>

  <p><i>The State of the Planet Mars, as Bearing on the Theory of
  Excentricity as a Cause of Glacial Periods.</i>&mdash;It is well known
  that the polar regions of the planet Mars are covered with white patches
  or discs, which undergo considerable alterations of size according as
  they are more or less exposed to the sun's rays. They have therefore been
  generally considered to be snow or ice-caps, and to prove that Mars is
  now undergoing something like a glacial period. It must always be
  remembered, however, that we are very ignorant of the exact physical
  conditions of the surface of Mars. It appears to have a cloudy atmosphere
  like our own, but the gaseous composition of that atmosphere may be
  different, and the clouds may be formed of other matter besides aqueous
  vapour. Its much smaller mass and attractive power must have an effect on
  the nature and extent of these clouds, and the heat of the sun may
  consequently be modified in a way quite different from anything that
  obtains upon our earth. Bearing these difficulties and uncertainties in
  mind, let us see what are the actual facts connected with the supposed
  polar snows of Mars.<a name="NtA_60"
  href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>{165}</span></p>

  <p>Mars offers an excellent subject for comparison with the Earth as
  regards this question, because its excentricity is now a little greater
  than the maximum excentricity of the Earth during the last million
  years,&mdash;(Mars excentricity 0.0931, Earth excentricity, 850,000 years
  back, 0.0707); the inclination of its axis is also a little greater than
  ours (Mars 28° 51&prime;, Earth 23° 27&prime;), and both Mars and the
  Earth are so situated that they now have the winter of their northern
  hemispheres in <i>perihelion</i>, that of their southern hemisphere being
  in <i>aphelion</i>. If, therefore, the physical condition of Mars were
  the same or nearly the same as that of the Earth, all circumstances
  combine, according to Dr. Croll's hypothesis, to produce a severe glacial
  epoch in its <i>southern</i>, with a perpetual spring or summer in its
  <i>northern</i>, hemisphere; while on the hypothesis here advocated we
  should expect glaciation at both poles. As a matter of fact Mars has two
  snow-caps, of nearly equal magnitude at their maximum in winter, but
  varying very unequally. The northern cap varies slowly and little, the
  southern varies rapidly and largely.</p>

  <p>In the year 1830 the <i>southern</i> snow was observed, during the
  midsummer of Mars, to diminish to half its former diameter in a fortnight
  (the duration of such phenomena on Mars being reckoned in Martian months
  equivalent to one-twelfth of a Martian year). Thus on June 23rd it was
  11° 30&prime; in diameter, and on July 9th had diminished to 5°
  46&prime;, after which it rapidly increased again. In 1837 the same cap
  was observed near its maximum in winter, and was found to be about 35° in
  diameter.</p>

  <p>In the same year the <i>northern</i> snow-cap was observed during its
  summer, and was found to vary as follows:&mdash;</p>

</table>

  <p>We thus see that Mars has two permanent snow-caps, of nearly equal
  size in winter but diminishing very unequally <!-- Page 166 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page166"></a>{166}</span>in summer, when the
  southern cap is reduced to nearly one third the size of the northern; and
  this fact is held by Mr. Carpenter, as it was by the late Mr. Belt, to be
  opposed to the view of the hemisphere which has winter in <i>aphelion</i>
  (as the southern now has both in the Earth and Mars), having been alone
  glaciated during periods of high excentricity.<a name="NtA_61"
  href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Before, however, we can draw any conclusion from the case of Mars, we
  must carefully scrutinise the facts, and the conditions they imply. In
  the first place, there is evidently this radical difference between the
  state of Mars now and of the Earth during a glacial period&mdash;that
  Mars has no great ice-sheets spreading over its temperate zone, as the
  Earth undoubtedly had. This we know from the fact of the <i>rapid</i>
  disappearance of the white patches over a belt three degrees wide in a
  fortnight (equal to a width of about 100 miles of our measure), and in
  the northern hemisphere of eight degrees wide (about 280 miles) between
  May 4th and July 12th. Even with our much more powerful sun, which gives
  us more than twice as much heat as Mars receives, no such diminution of
  an ice-sheet, or of glaciers of even moderate thickness, could possibly
  occur; but the phenomenon is on the contrary exactly analogous to what
  actually takes place on the plains of Siberia in summer. These, as I am
  informed by Mr. Seebohm, are covered with snow during winter and spring
  to a depth of six or eight feet, which diminishes very little even under
  the hot suns of May, till warm winds combine with the sun in June, when
  in about a fortnight the whole of it disappears, and a little later the
  whole of northern Asia is free from its winter covering. As, however, the
  sun of Mars is so much less powerful than ours, we may be <!-- Page 167
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>{167}</span>sure that the
  snow (if it is real snow) is much less thick&mdash;a mere surface-coating
  in fact, such as occurs in parts of Russia where the precipitation is
  less, and the snow accordingly does not exceed two or three feet in
  thickness.</p>

  <p>We now see the reason why the <i>southern</i> pole of Mars parts with
  its white covering so much more quickly and to so much greater an extent
  than the <i>northern</i>, for the south pole during summer is nearest the
  sun, and, owing to the great excentricity of Mars, would have about
  one-third more heat than during the summer of the northern hemisphere;
  and this greater heat would cause the winds from the equator to be both
  warmer and more powerful, and able to produce the same effects on the
  scanty Martian snows as they produce on our northern snow-plains. The
  reason why both poles of Mars are almost equally snow-covered in winter
  is not difficult to understand. Owing to the greater obliquity of the
  ecliptic, and the much greater length of the year, the polar regions will
  be subject to winter darkness fully twice as long as with us, and the
  fact that one pole is nearer the sun during this period than the other at
  a corresponding period, will therefore make no perceptible difference. It
  is also probable that the two poles of Mars are approximately alike as
  regards their geographical features, and that neither of them is
  surrounded by very high land on which ice may accumulate. With us at the
  present time, on the other hand, geographical conditions completely mask
  and even reverse the influence of excentricity, and that of winter in
  <i>perihelion</i> in the northern, and summer in <i>perihelion</i> in the
  southern, hemisphere. In the north we have a preponderance of sea within
  the Arctic circle, and of lowlands in the temperate zone. In the south
  exactly opposite conditions prevail, for there we have a preponderance of
  land (and much of it high land) within the Antarctic circle, and of sea
  in the temperate zone. Ice, therefore, accumulates in the south, while a
  thin coating of snow, easily melted in summer, is the prevalent feature
  in the north; and these contrasts react upon climate to such an extent,
  that in the southern ocean, islands in the latitude of Ireland have
  glaciers descending to the level of the sea, and constant snowstorms <!--
  Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168"></a>{168}</span>in
  the height of summer, although the sun is then actually nearer the earth
  than it is during our northern summer!</p>

  <p>It is evident, therefore, that the phenomena presented by the varying
  polar snows of Mars are in no way opposed to that modification of Dr.
  Croll's theory of the conditions which brought about the glacial epochs
  of our northern hemisphere, which is here advocated; but are perfectly
  explicable on the same general principles, if we keep in mind the
  distinction between an ice-sheet&mdash;which a summer's sun cannot
  materially diminish, but may even increase by bringing vapour to be
  condensed into snow&mdash;and a thin snowy covering which may be annually
  melted and annually renewed, with great rapidity and over large areas.
  Except within the small circles of perpetual polar snow there can at the
  present time be no ice-sheets in Mars; and the reason why this permanent
  snowy area is more extensive around the northern than around the southern
  pole may be partly due to higher land at the north, but is perhaps
  sufficiently explained by the diminished power of the summer sun, owing
  to its greatly increased distance at that season in the northern
  hemisphere, so that it is not able to melt so much of the snow which has
  accumulated during the long night of winter.</p>

  <p>If we adopt the view set forth in the preceding chapter as to the
  character of the glacial epoch and of the accompanying alternations of
  climate, it must have been a very important agent in producing changes in
  the distribution of animal and vegetable life. The intervening mild
  periods, which almost certainly occurred during its earlier and later
  phases, may have been sometimes more equable than even our present
  insular climate, and severe frosts were probably then unknown. During the
  four or five <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page170"></a>{170}</span>thousand years that each specially mild
  period may have lasted, some portions of the north temperate zone, which
  had been buried in snow or ice, would become again clothed with
  vegetation and stocked with animal life, both of which, as the cold again
  came on, would be driven southward, or perhaps partially exterminated.
  Forms usually separated would thus be crowded together, and a struggle
  for existence would follow, which must have led to the modification or
  the extinction of many species. When the survivors in the struggle had
  reached a state of equilibrium, a fresh field would be opened to them by
  the later ameliorations of climate; the more successful of the survivors
  would spread and multiply; and after this had gone on for thousands of
  generations, another change of climate, another southward migration,
  another struggle of northern and southern forms would take place.</p>

  <p>But if the last glacial epoch has coincided with, and has been to a
  considerable extent caused by, a high excentricity of the earth's orbit,
  we are naturally led to expect that earlier glacial epochs would have
  occurred whenever the excentricity was unusually large. Dr. Croll has
  published tables showing the varying amounts of excentricity for three
  million years back; and from these it appears that there have been many
  periods of high excentricity, which has often been far greater than at
  the time of the last glacial epoch.<a name="NtA_62"
  href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> The accompanying diagram has been drawn
  from these tables, and it will be seen that the highest excentricity
  occurred 850,000 years ago, at which time the difference between the
  sun's distance at <i>aphelion</i> and <i>perihelion</i> was thirteen and
  a half millions of miles, whereas during the last glacial period the
  maximum difference was ten and a half million miles.</p>

    DIAGRAM SHOWING THE CHANGES OF EXCENTRICITY DURING THE LAST THREE
    MILLION YEARS.
  </div>

  <p>Now, judging by the amount of organic and physical change that
  occurred during and since the glacial epoch, and that which has occurred
  since the Miocene period, it is considered probable that this maximum of
  excentricity coincided with some part of the latter period; and Dr. Croll
  maintains that a glacial epoch must then have <!-- Page 171 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>{171}</span>occurred surpassing in
  severity that of which we have such convincing proofs, and consisting
  like it of alternations of cold and warm phases every 10,500 years. The
  diagram also shows us another long-continued period of high excentricity
  from 1,750,000 to 1,950,000 years ago, and yet another almost equal to
  the maximum 2,500,000 years back. These may perhaps have occurred during
  the Eocene and Cretaceous epochs respectively, or all may have been
  included within the limits of the Tertiary period. As two of these high
  excentricities greatly exceed that which caused our glacial epoch, while
  the third is almost equal to it and of longer duration, they seem to
  afford us the means of testing rival theories of the causes of
  glaciation. If, as Dr. Croll argues, high excentricity is the great and
  dominating agency in bringing on glacial epochs, geographical changes
  being subordinate, then there must have been glacial epochs of great
  severity at all these three periods; while if he is also correct in
  supposing that the alternate phases of precession would inevitably
  produce glaciation in one hemisphere, and a proportionately mild and
  equable climate in the opposite hemisphere, then we should have to look
  for evidence of exceptionally warm and exceptionally cold periods,
  occurring <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page172"></a>{172}</span>alternately and with several repetitions,
  within a space of time which, geologically speaking, is very short
  indeed.</p>

  <p>Let us then inquire first into the character of the evidence we should
  expect to find of such changes of climate, if they have occurred; we
  shall then be in a better position to estimate at its proper value the
  evidence that actually exists, and, after giving it due weight, to arrive
  at some conclusion as to the theory that best explains and harmonises
  it.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Effects of Denudation in Destroying the Evidence of Remote Glacial
  Epochs.</i>&mdash;It may be supposed, that if earlier glacial epochs than
  the last did really occur, we ought to meet with some evidence of the
  fact corresponding to that which has satisfied us of the extensive recent
  glaciation of the northern hemisphere; but Dr. Croll and other writers
  have ably argued that no such evidence is likely to be found. It is now
  generally admitted that sub-aërial denudation is a much more powerful
  agent in lowering and modifying the surface of a country than was
  formerly supposed. It has in fact been proved to be so powerful that the
  difficulty now felt is, not to account for the denudation which can be
  proved to have occurred, but to explain the apparent persistence of
  superficial features which ought long ago to have been destroyed.</p>

  <p>A proof of the lowering and eating away of the land-surface which
  every one can understand, is to be found in the quantity of solid matter
  carried down to the sea and to low grounds by rivers. This is capable of
  pretty accurate measurement, and it has been carefully measured for
  several rivers, large and small, in different parts of the world. The
  details of these measurements will be given in a future chapter, and it
  is only necessary here to state that the average of them all gives us
  this result&mdash;that one foot must, on an average, be taken off the
  entire surface of the land each 3,000 years in order to produce the
  amount of sediment and matter in solution which is actually carried into
  the sea. To give an idea of the limits of variation in different rivers
  it may be mentioned that the Mississippi is one which denudes its valley
  at a slow rate, taking 6,000 <!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page173"></a>{173}</span>years to remove one foot; while the Po is
  the most rapid, taking only 729 years to do the same work in its valley.
  The cause of this difference is very easy to understand. A large part of
  the area of the Mississippi basin consists of the almost rainless prairie
  and desert regions of the west, while its sources are in comparatively
  arid mountains with scanty snow-fields, or in a low forest-clad plateau.
  The Po, on the other hand, is wholly in a district of abundant rainfall,
  while its sources are spread over a great amphitheatre of snowy Alps
  nearly 400 miles in extent, where the denuding forces are at a maximum.
  As Scotland is a mountain region of rather abundant rainfall, the
  denuding power of its rains and rivers is probably rather above than
  under the average, but to avoid any possible exaggeration we will take it
  at a foot in 4,000 years.</p>

  <p>Now if the end of the glacial epoch be taken to coincide with the
  termination of the last period of high excentricity, which occurred about
  80,000 years ago (and no geologist will consider this too long for the
  changes which have since taken place), it follows that the entire surface
  of Scotland must have been since lowered an average amount of twenty
  feet. But over large areas of alluvial plains, and wherever the rivers
  have spread during floods, the ground will have been raised instead of
  lowered; and on all nearly level ground and gentle slopes there will have
  been comparatively little denudation; so that proportionally much more
  must have been taken away from mountain sides and from the bottoms of
  valleys having a considerable downward slope. One of the very highest
  authorities on the subject of denudation, Mr. Archibald Geikie, estimates
  the area of these more rapidly denuded portions as only one-tenth of the
  comparatively level grounds, and he further estimates that the former
  will be denuded about ten times as fast as the latter. It follows that
  the valleys will be deepened and widened on the average about five feet
  in the 4,000 years instead of one foot; and thus many valleys must have
  been deepened and widened 100 feet, and some even more, since the glacial
  epoch, while the more level portions of the country will have been
  lowered on the average only about two feet. <!-- Page 174 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>{174}</span></p>

  <p>Now Dr. Croll gives us the following account of the present aspect of
  the surface of a large part of the country:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Go where one will in the lowlands of Scotland and he shall hardly
  find a single acre whose upper surface bears the marks of being formed by
  the denuding agents now in operation. He will observe everywhere mounds
  and hollows which cannot be accounted for by the present agencies at
  work.... In regard to the general surface of the country the present
  agencies may be said to be just beginning to carve a new line of features
  out of the old glacially-formed surface. But so little progress has yet
  been made, that the kames, gravel-mounds, knolls of boulder clay,
  &amp;c., still retain in most cases their original form."<a name="NtA_63"
  href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The facts here seem a little inconsistent, and we must suppose that
  Dr. Croll has somewhat exaggerated the universality and complete
  preservation of the glaciated surface. The amount of average denudation,
  however, is not a matter of opinion but of measurement; and its
  consequences can in no way be evaded. They are, moreover, strictly
  proportionate to the time elapsed; and if so much of the old surface of
  the country has certainly been remodelled or carried into the sea since
  the last glacial epoch, it becomes evident that any surface-phenomena
  produced by still earlier glacial epochs <i>must</i> have long since
  entirely disappeared.</p>

  <p><i>Rise of the Sea-level Connected with Glacial Epochs, a Cause of
  Further Denudation.</i>&mdash;There is also another powerful agent that
  must have assisted in the destruction of any such surface deposits or
  markings. During the last glacial epoch itself there were several minor
  oscillations of the land, without counting the great submergence of over
  1,300 feet, supposed to be indicated by patches of shelly clays and
  gravels in Wales and Ireland, and also in a few localities in England and
  Scotland, since these are otherwise explained by many geologists. Other
  subsidences have no doubt occurred in the same areas during the Tertiary
  epoch, and some writers connect these subsidences with the glacial <!--
  Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page175"></a>{175}</span>period itself, the unequal amount of ice
  at the two poles causing the centre of gravity of the earth to be
  displaced when, of course, the surface of the ocean will conform to it
  and appear to rise in the one hemisphere and sink in the other. If this
  is the case, subsidences of the land are natural concomitants of a
  glacial period, and will powerfully aid in removing all evidence of its
  occurrence. We have seen reason to believe, however, that during the
  height of the glacial epoch the extreme cold persisted through the
  successive phases of precession, and if so, both polar areas would
  probably be glaciated at once. This would cause the abstraction of a
  large quantity of water from the ocean, and a proportionate elevation of
  the land, which would react on the accumulation of snow and ice, and thus
  add another to that wonderful series of physical agents which act and
  react on each other so as to intensify glacial epochs.</p>

  <p>But whether or not these causes would produce any important
  fluctuations of the sea-level is of comparatively little importance to
  our present inquiry, because the wide extent of marine Tertiary deposits
  in the northern hemisphere and their occurrence at considerable
  elevations above the present sea-level, afford the most conclusive proofs
  that great changes of sea and land have occurred throughout the entire
  Tertiary period; and these repeated submergences and emergences of the
  land combined with sub-aërial and marine denudation, would undoubtedly
  destroy all those superficial evidences of ice-action on which we mainly
  depend for proofs of the occurrence of the last glacial epoch.</p>

  <p><i>What Evidence of Early Glacial Epochs may be
  Expected.</i>&mdash;Although we may admit the force of the preceding
  argument as to the extreme improbability of our finding any clear
  evidence of the superficial action of ice during remote glacial epochs,
  there is nevertheless one kind of evidence that we ought to find, because
  it is both wide-spread and practically indestructible.</p>

  <p>One of the most constant of all the phenomena of a glaciated country
  is the abundance of icebergs produced by the breaking off of the ends of
  glaciers which terminate <!-- Page 176 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page176"></a>{176}</span>in arms of the sea, or of the terminal
  face of the ice-sheet which passes beyond the land into the ocean. In
  both these cases abundance of rocks and <i>débris</i>, such as form the
  terminal moraines of glaciers on land, are carried out to sea and
  deposited over the sea-bottom of the area occupied by icebergs. In the
  case of an ice-sheet it is almost certain that much of the
  ground-moraine, consisting of mud and imbedded stones, similar to that
  which forms the "till" when deposited on land, will be carried out to sea
  with the ice and form a deposit of marine "till" near the shore.</p>

  <p>It has indeed been objected that when an ice-sheet covered an entire
  country there would be no moraines, and that rocks or <i>débris</i> are
  very rarely seen on icebergs. But during every glacial epoch there will
  be a southern limit to the glaciated area, and everywhere near this limit
  the mountain-tops will rise far above the ice and deposit on it great
  masses of <i>débris</i>; and as the ice-sheet spreads, and again as it
  passes away, this moraine-forming area will successively occupy the whole
  country. But even such an ice-clad country as Greenland is now known to
  have protruding peaks and rocky masses which give rise to moraines on its
  surface;<a name="NtA_64" href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> and, as rocks
  from Cumberland and Ireland were carried by the ice-sheet to the Isle of
  Man, there must have been a very long period during which the ice-sheets
  of Britain and Ireland terminated in the ocean and sent off abundance of
  rock-laden bergs into the surrounding seas; and the same thing must have
  occurred along all the coasts of Northern Europe and Eastern America.</p>

  <p>We cannot therefore doubt that throughout the greater part of the
  duration of a glacial epoch the seas adjacent to the glaciated countries
  would receive continual deposits of large rocks, rock-fragments, and
  gravel, similar to the material of modern and ancient moraines, and
  analogous to the drift and the numerous travelled blocks which the ice
  has undoubtedly scattered broadcast over every glaciated country; and
  these rocks and boulders would be imbedded in whatever deposits were then
  forming, either from the matter carried down by rivers or from the mud
  ground off <!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page177"></a>{177}</span>the rocks and carried out to sea by the
  glaciers themselves. Moreover, as icebergs float far beyond the limits of
  the countries which gave them birth, these ice-borne materials would be
  largely imbedded in deposits forming from the denudation of countries
  which had never been glaciated, or from which the ice had already
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>But if every period of high excentricity produced a glacial epoch of
  greater or less extent and severity, then, on account of the frequent
  occurrence of a high phase of excentricity during the three million years
  for which we have the tables, these boulder and rock-strewn deposits
  would be both numerous and extensive. Four hundred thousand years ago the
  excentricity was almost exactly the same as it is now, and it continually
  increased from that time up to the glacial epoch. Now if we take double
  the present excentricity as being sufficient to produce some glaciation
  in the temperate zone, we find (by drawing out the diagram at p. <a
  href="#page171">171</a> on a larger scale) that during 1,150,000 years
  out of the 2,400,000 years immediately preceding the last glacial epoch,
  the excentricity reached or exceeded this amount, consisting of sixteen
  separate epochs, divided from each other by periods varying from 30,000
  to 200,000 years. But if the last glacial epoch was at its maximum
  200,000 years ago, a space of three million years will certainly include
  much, if not all, of the Tertiary period; and even if it does not, we
  have no reason to suppose that the character of the excentricity would
  suddenly change beyond the three million years.</p>

  <p>It follows, therefore, that if periods of high excentricity, like that
  which appears to have been synchronous with our last glacial epoch and is
  generally admitted to have been one of its efficient causes, always
  produced glacial epochs (with or without alternating warm periods), then
  the whole of the Tertiary deposits in the north temperate and Arctic
  zones should exhibit frequent alternations of boulder and rock-bearing
  beds, or coarse rock-strewn gravels analogous to our existing glacial
  drift, and with some corresponding change of organic remains. Let us then
  see what evidence can be adduced of the existence of such deposits, and
  whether it is adequate to support the <!-- Page 178 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>{178}</span>theory of repeated
  glacial epochs during the Tertiary period.</p>

  <p><i>Evidences of Ice-action during the Tertiary Period.</i>&mdash;The
  Tertiary fossils both of Europe and North America indicate throughout
  warm or temperate climates, except those of the more recent Pliocene
  deposits which merge into the earlier glacial beds. The Miocene deposits
  of Central and Southern Europe, for example, contain marine shells of
  some genera now only found farther south, while the fossil plants often
  resemble those of Madeira and the southern states of North America. Large
  reptiles, too, abounded, and man-like apes lived in the south of France
  and in Germany. Yet in Northern Italy, near Turin, there are beds of
  sandstone and conglomerate full of characteristic Miocene shells, but
  containing in an intercalated deposit angular blocks of serpentine and
  greenstone often of enormous size, one being fourteen feet long, and
  another twenty-six feet. Some of the blocks were observed by Sir Charles
  Lyell to be faintly striated and partly polished on one side, and they
  are scattered through the beds for a thickness of nearly 150 feet. It is
  interesting that the particular bed in which the blocks occur yields no
  organic remains, though these are plentiful both in the underlying and
  overlying beds, as if the cold of the icebergs, combined with the
  turbidity produced by the glacial mud, had driven away the organisms
  adapted to live only in a comparatively warm sea. Rock similar in kind to
  these erratics occurs about twenty miles distant in the Alps.</p>

  <p>The Eocene period is even more characteristically tropical in its
  flora and fauna, since palms and Cycadaceæ, turtles, snakes, and
  crocodiles then inhabited England. Yet on the north side of the Alps,
  extending from Switzerland to Vienna, and also south of the Alps near
  Genoa, there is a deposit of finely-stratified sandstone several thousand
  feet in thickness, quite destitute of organic remains, but containing in
  several places in Switzerland enormous blocks either angular or partly
  rounded, and composed of oolitic limestone or of granite. Near the Lake
  of Thun some of the granite blocks found in this deposit are of enormous
  size, one of them being 105 feet long, ninety feet wide, <!-- Page 179
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>{179}</span>and forty-five
  feet thick! The granite is red, and of a peculiar kind which cannot be
  matched anywhere in the Alps, or indeed elsewhere. Similar erratics have
  also been found in beds of the same age in the Carpathians and in the
  Apennines, indicating probably an extensive inland European sea into
  which glaciers descended from the surrounding mountains, depositing these
  erratics, and cooling the water so as to destroy the mollusca and other
  organisms which had previously inhabited it. It is to be observed that
  wherever these erratics occur they are always in the vicinity of great
  mountain ranges; and although these can be proved to have been in great
  part elevated during the Tertiary period, we must also remember that they
  must have been since very much lowered by denudation, of the amount of
  which, the enormously thick Eocene and Miocene beds now forming portions
  of them is in some degree a measure as well as a proof. It is not
  therefore at all improbable that during some part of the Tertiary period
  these mountains may have been far higher than they are now, and this we
  know might be sufficient for the production of glaciers descending to the
  sea-level, even were the climate of the lowlands somewhat warmer than at
  present.<a name="NtA_65" href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>The Weight of the Negative Evidence.</i>&mdash;But when we proceed
  to examine the Tertiary deposits of other parts of <!-- Page 180 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>{180}</span>Europe, and especially
  of our own country, for evidence of this kind, not only is such evidence
  completely wanting, but the facts are of so definite a character as to
  satisfy most geologists that it can never have existed; and the same
  maybe said of temperate North America and of the Arctic regions
  generally.</p>

  <p>In his carefully written paper on "The Climate Controversy" the late
  Mr. Searles V. Wood, Jun., remarks on this point as follows: "Now the
  Eocene formation is complete in England, and is exposed in continuous
  section along the north coast of the Isle of Wight from its base to its
  junction with the Oligocene (or Lower Miocene according to some), and
  along the northern coast of Kent from its base to the Lower Bagshot Sand.
  It has been intersected by railway and other cuttings in all directions
  and at all horizons, and pierced by wells innumerable; while from its
  strata in England, France, and Belgium, the most extensive collections of
  organic remains have been made of any formation yet explored, and from
  nearly all its horizons, for at one place or another in these three
  countries nearly every horizon may be said to have yielded fossils of
  some kind. These fossils, however, whether they be the remains of a flora
  such as that of Sheppey, or of a vertebrate fauna containing the
  crocodile and alligator, such as is yielded by beds indicative of
  terrestrial conditions, or of a molluscan assemblage such as is present
  in marine or fluvio-marine beds of the formation, are of unmistakably
  tropical or sub-tropical character throughout; and no trace whatever has
  appeared of the intercalation of a glacial period, much less of
  successive intercalations indicative of more than one period of 10,500
  years' glaciation. Nor can it be urged that the glacial epochs of the
  Eocene in England were intervals of dry land, and so have left no
  evidence of their existence behind them, because a large part of the
  continuous sequence of Eocene deposits in this country consists of
  alternations of fluviatile, fluvio-marine, and purely marine strata; so
  that it seems impossible that during the accumulation of the Eocene
  formation in England a glacial period could have occurred without its
  evidences being <!-- Page 181 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page181"></a>{181}</span>abundantly apparent. The Oligocene of
  Northern Germany and Belgium, and the Miocene of those countries and of
  France, have also afforded a rich molluscan fauna, which, like that of
  the Eocene, has as yet presented no indication of the intrusion of
  anything to interfere with its uniformly sub-tropical character."<a
  name="NtA_66" href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This is sufficiently striking; but when we consider that this enormous
  series of deposits, many thousand feet in thickness, consists wholly of
  alternations of clays, sands, marls, shales, or limestones, with a few
  beds of pebbles or conglomerate, not one of the whole series containing
  irregular blocks of foreign material, boulders or gravel, such as we have
  seen to be the essential characteristic of a glacial epoch; and when we
  find that this same general character pervades all the extensive Tertiary
  deposits of temperate North America, we shall, I think, be forced to the
  conclusion that no general glacial epochs could have occurred during
  their formation. It must be remembered that the "imperfection of the
  geological record" will not help us here, because the series of Tertiary
  deposits is unusually complete, and we must suppose some destructive
  agency to have selected all the intercalated glacial beds and to have so
  completely made away with them that not a fragment remains, while
  preserving all or almost all the <i>interglacial</i> beds; and to have
  acted thus capriciously, not in one limited area only, but over the whole
  northern hemisphere, with the local exceptions on the flanks of great
  mountain ranges already referred to.</p>

  <p><i>Temperate Climates in the Arctic Regions.</i>&mdash;As we have just
  seen, the geological evidence of the persistence of sub-tropical or warm
  climates in the north temperate zone during the greater part of the
  Tertiary period is almost irresistible, and we have now to consider the
  still more extraordinary series of observations which demonstrate that
  this amelioration of climate extended into the Arctic zone, and into
  countries now almost wholly buried in snow and ice. These warm Arctic
  climates have been explained by Dr. Croll as due to periods of high
  excentricity with winter in <i>perihelion</i>, a theory which implies
  alternating <!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page182"></a>{182}</span>epochs of glaciation far exceeding what
  now prevails; and it is therefore necessary to examine the evidence
  pretty closely in order to see if this view is more tenable in the case
  of the north polar regions than we have found it to be in that of the
  north temperate zone.</p>

  <p>The most recent of these milder climates is perhaps indicated by the
  abundant remains of large mammalia&mdash;such as the mammoth, woolly
  rhinoceros, bison and horse, in the icy alluvial plains of Northern
  Siberia, and especially in the Liakhov Islands in the same latitude as
  the North Cape of Asia. These remains occur not in one or two spots only,
  as if collected by eddies at the mouth of a river, but along the whole
  borders of the Arctic Ocean; and it is generally admitted that the
  animals must have lived upon the adjacent plains, and that a considerably
  milder climate than now prevails could alone have enabled them to do so.
  How long ago this occurred we do not know, but one of the last
  intercalated mild periods of the glacial epoch itself seems to offer all
  the necessary conditions. Again, Sir Edward Belcher discovered on the
  dreary shores of Wellington Channel in 75½° N. Lat. the trunk and root of
  a fir tree which had evidently grown where it was found. It appeared to
  belong to the species <i>Abies alba</i>, or white fir, which now reaches
  68° N. Lat. and is the most northerly conifer known. Similar trees, one
  four feet in circumference and thirty feet long, were found by Lieut.
  Mecham in Prince Patrick's Island in Lat. 76° 12&prime; N., and other
  Arctic explorers have found remains of trees in high latitudes.<a
  name="NtA_67" href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Similar indications of a recent milder climate are found in
  Spitzbergen. Professor Nordenskjöld says: "At various places on
  Spitzbergen, at the bottom of Lomme Bay, at Cape Thordsen, in
  Blomstrand's strata in Advent Bay, there are found large and
  well-developed shells of a bivalve, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>, which is not
  now found living on the coast of Spitzbergen, though on the west coast of
  Scandinavia it everywhere covers the rocks near the sea-shore. These
  shells occur most plentifully in the bed of a river which runs through
  Reindeer Valley at Cape Thordsen. They <!-- Page 183 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>{183}</span>are probably washed out
  of a thin bed of sand at a height of about twenty or thirty feet above
  the present sea-level, which is intersected by the river. The geological
  age of this bed cannot be very great, and it has clearly been formed
  since the present basin of the Ice Sound, or at least the greater part of
  it, has been hollowed out by glacial action."<a name="NtA_68"
  href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>The Miocene Arctic Flora.</i>&mdash;One of the most startling and
  important of the scientific discoveries of the last forty years has been
  that of the relics of a luxuriant Miocene flora in various parts of the
  Arctic regions. It is a discovery that was totally unexpected, and is
  even now considered by many men of science to be completely
  unintelligible; but it is so thoroughly established, and it has such a
  direct and important bearing on the subjects we are discussing in the
  present volume, that it is necessary to lay a tolerably complete outline
  of the facts before our readers.</p>

  <p>The Miocene flora of temperate Europe was very like that of Eastern
  Asia, Japan, and the warmer part of Eastern North America of the present
  day. It is very richly represented in Switzerland by well preserved
  fossil remains, and after a close comparison with the flora of other
  countries Professor Heer concludes that the Swiss Lower Miocene flora
  indicates a climate corresponding to that of Louisiana, North Africa, and
  South China, while the Upper Miocene climate of the same country would
  correspond to that of the south of Spain, Southern Japan, and Georgia
  (U.S. of America). Of this latter flora, found chiefly at &OElig;ninghen
  in the northern extremity of Switzerland, 465 species are known, of which
  166 species are trees or shrubs, half of them being evergreens. They
  comprise sequoias like the Californian giant trees, camphor-trees,
  cinnamons, sassafras, bignonias, cassias, gleditschias, tulip-trees, and
  many other American genera, together with maples, ashes, planes, oaks,
  poplars, and other familiar European trees represented by a variety of
  extinct species. If we now go to the west coast of Greenland in 70° N.
  Lat. we find abundant remains of a flora of the same general <!-- Page
  184 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>{184}</span>type as
  that of &OElig;ninghen but of a more northern character. We have a
  sequoia identical with one of the species found at &OElig;ninghen, a
  chestnut, salisburia, liquidambar, sassafras, and even a magnolia. We
  have also seven species of oaks, two planes, two vines, three beeches,
  four poplars, two willows, a walnut, a plum, and several shrubs supposed
  to be evergreens; altogether 137 species, mostly well and abundantly
  preserved!</p>

  <p>But even further north, in Spitzbergen, in 78° and 79° N. Lat. and one
  of the most barren and inhospitable regions on the globe, an almost
  equally rich fossil flora has been discovered including several of the
  Greenland species, and others peculiar, but mostly of the same genera.
  There seem to be no evergreens here except coniferæ, one of which is
  identical with the swamp-cypress (<i>Taxodium distichum</i>) now found
  living in the Southern United States! There are also eleven pines, two
  Libocedrus, two sequoias, with oaks, poplars, birches, planes, limes, a
  hazel, an ash, and a walnut; also water-lilies, pond-weeds, and an
  iris&mdash;altogether about a hundred species of flowering plants. Even
  in Grinnell Land, within 8¼ degrees of the pole, a similar flora existed,
  twenty-five species of fossil plants having been collected by the last
  Arctic expedition, of which eighteen were identical with the species from
  other Arctic localities. This flora comprised poplars, birches, hazels,
  elms, viburnums, and eight species of conifers including the swamp
  cypress and the Norway spruce (<i>Pinus abies</i>) which last does not
  now extend beyond 69½° N.</p>

  <p>Fossil plants closely resembling those just mentioned have been found
  at many other Arctic localities, especially in Iceland, on the Mackenzie
  River in 65° N. Lat. and in Alaska. As an intermediate station we have,
  in the neighbourhood of Dantzic in Lat. 55° N., a similar flora, with the
  swamp-cypress, sequoias, oaks, poplars, and some cinnamons, laurels, and
  figs. A little further south, near Breslau, north of the Carpathians, a
  rich flora has been found allied to that of &OElig;ninghen, but wanting
  in some of the more tropical forms. Again, in the Isle of Mull in
  Scotland, in about 56½° N. Lat., a plant-bed has been discovered <!--
  Page 185 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page185"></a>{185}</span>containing a hazel, a plane, and a
  sequoia, apparently identical with a Swiss Miocene species.</p>

  <p>We thus find one well-marked type of vegetation spread from
  Switzerland and Vienna to North Germany, Scotland, Iceland, Greenland,
  Alaska, and Spitzbergen, some few of the species even ranging over the
  extremes of latitude between &OElig;ninghen and Spitzbergen, but the
  great majority being distinct, and exhibiting decided indications of a
  decrease of temperature according to latitude, though much less in amount
  than now exists. Some writers have thought that the great similarity of
  the floras of Greenland and &OElig;ninghen is a proof that they were not
  contemporaneous, but successive; and that of Greenland has been supposed
  to be as old as the Eocene. But the arguments yet adduced do not seem to
  prove such a difference of age, because there is only that amount of
  specific and generic diversity between the two which might be produced by
  distance and difference of temperature, under the exceptionally equable
  climate of the period. We have even now examples of an equally wide range
  of well-marked types; as in temperate South America, where many of the
  genera and some of the species range from the Straits of Magellan to
  Valparaiso&mdash;places differing as much in latitude as Switzerland and
  West Greenland; and the same may be said of North Australia and Tasmania,
  where, at a greater latitudinal distance apart, closely allied forms of
  Eucalyptus, Acacia, Casuarina, Stylidium, Goodenia, and many other genera
  would certainly form a prominent feature in any fossil flora now being
  preserved.</p>

  <p><i>Mild Arctic Climates of the Cretaceous Period.</i>&mdash;In the
  Upper Cretaceous deposits of Greenland (in a locality not far from those
  of the Miocene age last described) another remarkable flora has been
  discovered, agreeing generally with that of Europe and North America of
  the same geological age. Sixty-five species of plants have been
  identified, of which there are fifteen ferns, two cycads, eleven
  coniferæ, three monocotyledons, and thirty-four dicotyledons. One of the
  ferns is a tree-fern with thick stems, which has also been found in the
  Upper Greensand of England. Among the conifers the giant sequoias are
  found, and among <!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page186"></a>{186}</span>the dicotyledons the genera Populus,
  Myrica, Ficus, Sassafras, Andromeda, Diospyros, Myrsine, Panax, as well
  as magnolias, myrtles, and leguminosæ. Several of these groups occur also
  in the much richer deposits of the same age in North America and Central
  Europe; but all of them evidently afford such fragmentary records of the
  actual flora of the period, that it is impossible to say that any genus
  found in one locality was absent from the other merely because it has not
  yet been found there. On the whole, there seems to be less difference
  between the floras of Arctic and temperate latitudes in Upper Cretaceous
  than in Miocene times.</p>

  <p>In the same locality in Greenland (70° 33&prime; N. Lat. and 52° W.
  Long.), and also in Spitzbergen, a more ancient flora, of Lower
  Cretaceous age, has been found; but it differs widely from the other in
  the great abundance of cycads and conifers and the scarcity of exogens,
  which latter are represented by a single poplar. Of the thirty-eight
  ferns, fifteen belong to the genus Gleichenia now almost entirely
  tropical. There are four genera of cycads, and three extinct genera of
  conifers, besides Glyptostrobus and Torreya now found only in China and
  California, six species of true pines, and five of the genus Sequoia, one
  of which occurs also in Spitzbergen. The European deposits of the same
  age closely agree with these in their general character, conifers,
  cycads, and ferns forming the mass of the vegetation, while exogens are
  entirely absent, the above-named Greenland poplar being the oldest known
  dicotyledonous plant.<a name="NtA_69"
  href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

  <p>If we take these facts as really representing the flora of the period,
  we shall be forced to conclude that, measured by the change effected in
  its plants, the lapse of time between the Lower and Upper Cretaceous
  deposits was far greater than between the Upper Cretaceous and the
  Miocene&mdash;a conclusion quite opposed to the indications afforded by
  the mollusca and the higher animals of the two periods. It seems
  probable, therefore, that these Lower Cretaceous plants represent local
  peculiarities of <!-- Page 187 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page187"></a>{187}</span>vegetation such as now sometimes occur in
  tropical countries. On sandy or coralline islands in the Malay
  Archipelago there will often be found a vegetation consisting almost
  wholly of cycads, pandani, and palms, while a few miles off, on
  moderately elevated land, not a single specimen of either of these
  families may be seen, but a dense forest of dicotyledonous trees covering
  the whole country. A lowland vegetation, such as that above described,
  might be destroyed and its remains preserved by a slight depression,
  allowing it to be covered up by the detritus of some adjacent river,
  while not only would the subsidence of high land be a less frequent
  occurrence, but when it did occur the steep banks would be undermined by
  the waves, and the trees falling down would be floated away, and would
  either be cast on some distant shore or slowly decay on the surface or in
  the depths of the ocean.</p>

  <p>From the remarkable series of facts now briefly summarized, we learn,
  that whenever plant-remains have been discovered within the Arctic
  regions, either in Tertiary or Cretaceous deposits, they show that the
  climate was one capable of supporting a rich vegetation of trees, shrubs,
  and herbaceous plants, similar in general character to that which
  prevailed in the temperate zone at the same periods, but showing the
  influence of a less congenial climate. These deposits belong to at least
  four distinct geological horizons, and have been found widely scattered
  within the Arctic circle, yet nowhere has any proof been obtained of
  intercalated cold periods, such as would be indicated by the remains of a
  stunted vegetation, or a molluscan fauna similar to that which now
  prevails there.</p>

  <p><i>Stratigraphical Evidence of Long-Continued Mild Arctic
  Conditions.</i>&mdash;Let us now turn to the stratigraphical evidence,
  which, as we have already shown, offers a crucial test of the occurrence
  or non-occurrence of glaciation during any extensive geological period;
  and here we have the testimony of perhaps the greatest living authority
  on Arctic geology&mdash;Professor Nordenskjöld. In his lecture on "The
  Former Climate of the Polar Regions," he says: "The character of the
  coasts in the Arctic regions is especially favourable to geological
  investigations. While the valleys are for the <!-- Page 188 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>{188}</span>most part filled with
  ice, the sides of the mountains in summer, even in the 80th degree of
  latitude, and to a height of 1,000 or 1,500 feet above the level of the
  sea, are almost wholly free from snow. Nor are the rocks covered with any
  amount of vegetation worth mentioning; and, moreover, the sides of the
  mountains on the shore itself frequently present perpendicular sections,
  which everywhere expose their bare surfaces to the investigator. The
  knowledge of a mountain's geognostic character, at which one, in the more
  southerly countries, can only arrive after long and laborious researches,
  removal of soil and the like, is here gained almost at the first glance;
  and as we have never seen in Spitzbergen nor in Greenland, in these
  sections often many miles in length, and including one may say all
  formations from the Silurian to the Tertiary, any boulders even as large
  as a child's head, there is not the smallest probability that strata of
  any considerable extent, containing boulders, are to be found in the
  polar tracts previous to the middle of the Tertiary period. Since, then,
  both an examination of the geognostic condition, and an investigation of
  the fossil flora and fauna of the polar lands, show no signs of a glacial
  era having existed in those parts before the termination of the Miocene
  period, we are fully justified in rejecting, on the evidence of actual
  observation, the hypotheses founded on purely theoretical speculations,
  which assume the many times repeated alternation of warm and glacial
  climates between the present time and the earliest geological ages."<a
  name="NtA_70" href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> And again, in his
  <i>Sketch of the Geology of Spitzbergen</i>, after describing the various
  formations down to the Miocene, he says: "All the fossils found in the
  foregoing strata show that Spitzbergen, during former geological ages,
  enjoyed a magnificent climate, which indeed was somewhat colder during
  the Miocene period, but was still favourable for an extraordinarily
  abundant vegetation, much more luxuriant than that which now occurs even
  in the southern part of Scandinavia: and I have in those strata sought in
  vain for any sign, that, as some geologists have of late endeavoured to
  render probable, these favourable climatic conditions have been broken
  off <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page189"></a>{189}</span>by intervals of ancient glacial periods.
  The profiles I have had the opportunity to examine during my various
  Spitzbergen expeditions would certainly, if laid down on a line, occupy
  an extent of <i>a thousand English miles</i>; and if any former glacial
  period had existed in this region, there ought to have been some trace to
  be observed of erratic blocks, or other formations which distinguish
  glacial action. But this has not been the case. In the strata, whose
  length I have reckoned alone, I have not found a single fragment of a
  foreign rock so large as a child's head."<a name="NtA_71"
  href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Now it is quite impossible to ignore or evade the force of this
  testimony as to the continuous warm climates of the north temperate and
  polar zones throughout Tertiary times. The evidence extends over a vast
  area, both in space and time, it is derived from the work of the most
  competent living geologists, and it is absolutely consistent in its
  general tendency. We have in the Lower Cretaceous period an almost
  tropical climate in France and England, a somewhat lower temperature in
  the United States, and a mild insular climate in the Arctic regions. In
  each successive period the climate becomes somewhat less tropical; but
  down to the Upper Miocene it remains warm temperate in Central Europe,
  and cold temperate within the polar area, with not a trace of any
  intervening periods of Arctic cold. It then gradually cools down and
  merges through the Pliocene into the glacial epoch in Europe, while in
  the Arctic zone there is a break in the record between the Miocene and
  the recent glacial deposits.<a name="NtA_72"
  href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>{190}</span></p>

  <p>Accepting this as a substantially correct account of the general
  climatic aspect of the Tertiary period in the northern hemisphere, let us
  see whether the principles we have already laid down will enable us to
  give a satisfactory explanation of its causes.</p>

  <p><i>The Causes of mild Arctic Climates.</i>&mdash;In his remarkable
  series of papers on "Ocean Currents," the late Dr. James Croll has
  proved, with a wealth of argument and illustration whose cogency is
  irresistible, that the very habitability of our globe is due to the
  equalizing climatic effects of the waters of the ocean; and that it is to
  the same cause that we owe, either directly or indirectly, almost all the
  chief diversities of climate between places situated in the same
  latitude. Owing to the peculiar distribution of land and sea upon the
  globe, more than its fair proportion of the warm equatorial waters is
  directed towards the western shores of Europe, the result being that the
  British Isles, Norway, and Spitzbergen, have all a milder climate than
  any other parts of the globe in corresponding latitudes. A very small
  portion of the Arctic regions, however, obtains this benefit, and it thus
  remains, generally speaking, a land of snow and ice, with too short a
  summer to nourish more than a very scanty and fugitive vegetation. The
  only other opening than that between Iceland and Britain by which warm
  water penetrates within the Arctic circle, is through Behring's Straits;
  but this is both shallow and limited in width, and the consequence is
  that the larger part of the warm currents of the Pacific turns back along
  the shores of the Aleutian Islands and North-west America, while a very
  small quantity enters the icy ocean.</p>

  <p>But if there were other and wider openings into the Arctic Ocean, a
  vast quantity of the heated water which is now turned backward would
  enter it, and would produce an amelioration of the climate of which we
  can hardly form a conception. A great amelioration of climate would also
  be caused by the breaking up or the lowering of such <!-- Page 191
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>{191}</span>Arctic
  highlands as now favour the accumulation of ice; while the
  interpenetration of the sea into any part of the great continents in the
  tropical or temperate zones would again tend to raise the winter
  temperature, and render any long continuance of snow in their vicinity
  almost impossible.</p>

  <p>Now geologists have proved, quite independently of any such questions
  as we are here discussing, that changes of the very kinds above referred
  to have occurred during the Tertiary period; and that there has been,
  speaking broadly, a steady change from a comparatively fragmentary and
  insular condition of the great north temperate lands in early Tertiary
  times, to that more compact and continental condition which now prevails.
  It is, no doubt, difficult and often impossible to determine how long any
  particular geographical condition lasted, or whether the changes in one
  country were exactly coincident with those in another; but it will be
  sufficient for our purpose briefly to indicate those more important
  changes of land and sea during the Tertiary period, which must have
  produced a decided effect on the climate of the northern hemisphere.</p>

  <p><i>Geographical Changes Favouring Mild Northern Climates in Tertiary
  Times.</i>&mdash;The distribution of the Eocene and Miocene formations
  shows, that during a considerable portion of the Tertiary period, an
  inland sea, more or less occupied by an archipelago of islands, extended
  across Central Europe between the Baltic and the Black and Caspian Seas,
  and thence by narrower channels south-eastward to the valley of the
  Euphrates and the Persian Gulf, thus opening a communication between the
  North Atlantic and the Indian Oceans. From the Caspian also a wide arm of
  the sea extended during some part of the Tertiary epoch northwards to the
  Arctic Ocean, and there is nothing to show that this sea may not have
  been in existence during the whole Tertiary period. Another channel
  probably existed over Egypt<a name="NtA_73"
  href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> into the eastern <!-- Page 192 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>{192}</span>basin of the
  Mediterranean and the Black Sea; while it is probable that there was a
  communication between the Baltic and the White Sea, leaving Scandinavia
  as an extensive island. Turning to India, we find that an arm of the sea
  of great width and depth extended from the Bay of Bengal to the mouths of
  the Indus; while the enormous depression indicated by the presence of
  marine fossils of Eocene age at a height of 10,500 feet in Western Tibet,
  renders it not improbable that a more direct channel across Afghanistan
  may have opened a communication between the West Asiatic and Polar
  seas.</p>

  <p>It may be said that the changes here indicated are not warranted by an
  actual knowledge of continuous Tertiary deposits over the situations of
  the alleged marine channels; but it is no less certain that the seas in
  which any particular strata were deposited were <i>always</i> more
  extensive than the fragments of those strata now existing, and
  <i>often</i> immensely more extensive. The Eocene deposits of Europe, for
  example, have certainly undergone enormous denudation both marine and
  subaërial, and may have once covered areas where we now find older
  deposits (as the chalk once covered the weald), while a portion of them
  may lie concealed under Miocene, Pliocene, or recent beds. We find them
  widely scattered over Europe and Asia, and often elevated into lofty
  mountain ranges; and we should certainly err far more seriously in
  confining the Eocene seas to the exact areas where we now find Eocene
  rocks, than in liberally extending them, so as to connect the several
  detached portions of the formation whenever there is no valid argument
  against our doing so. Considering then, that some one or more of the
  sea-communications here indicated almost certainly existed during Eocene
  and Miocene times, let us endeavour to estimate the probable effect such
  communications would have upon the climate of the northern
  hemisphere.</p>

  <p><i>The Indian Ocean as a Source of Heat in Tertiary
  Times.</i>&mdash;If we compare the Indian Ocean with the South Atlantic
  we shall see that the position and outline of the former are very
  favourable for the accumulation of a large body of warm water moving
  northwards. Its southern <!-- Page 193 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page193"></a>{193}</span>opening between South Africa and Australia
  is very wide, and the tendency of the trade-winds would be to concentrate
  the currents towards its north-western extremity, just where the two
  great channels above described formed an outlet to the northern seas. As
  will be shown in our nineteenth chapter, there was probably, during the
  earlier portion of the Tertiary period at least, several large islands in
  the space between Madagascar and South India; but these had wide and deep
  channels between them, and their existence may have been favourable to
  the conveyance of heated water northward, by concentrating the currents,
  and thus producing massive bodies of moving water analogous to the Gulf
  Stream of the Atlantic.<a name="NtA_74" href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a>
  Less heat would thus be lost by evaporation and radiation in the tropical
  zone, and an impulse would be acquired which would carry the warm water
  into the north polar area. About the same period Australia was probably
  divided into two islands, separated by a wide channel in a north and
  south direction (see Chapter XXII.), and through this another current
  would almost certainly set northwards, and be directed to the north-west
  by the southern extension of Malayan Asia. The more insular condition at
  this period of Australia, India, and North Africa, with the depression
  and probable fertility of the Central Asiatic plateau, would lead to the
  Indian Ocean being traversed by regular trade-winds instead of by
  variable monsoons, and thus the constant <i>vis a tergo</i>, which is so
  efficient in the Atlantic, would keep up a steady and powerful current
  towards the northern parts of the Indian Ocean, and thence through the
  midst of the European archipelago to the northern seas.</p>

  <p>Now it is quite certain that such a condition as we have here sketched
  out would produce a wonderful effect on the climate of Central Europe and
  Western and Northern Asia. Owing to the warm currents being concentrated
  in inland seas instead of being dispersed over a wide ocean like the <!--
  Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194"></a>{194}</span>North
  Atlantic, much more heat would be conveyed into the Arctic Ocean, and
  this would altogether prevent the formation of ice on the northern shores
  of Asia, which continent did not then extend nearly so far north and was
  probably deeply inter-penetrated by the sea. This open ocean to the
  north, and the warm currents along all the northern lands, would so
  equalise temperature, that even the northern parts of Europe might then
  have enjoyed a climate fully equal to that of the warmer parts of New
  Zealand at the present day, and might have well supported the luxuriant
  vegetation of the Miocene period, even without any help from similar
  changes in the western hemisphere.<a name="NtA_75"
  href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Condition of North America during the Tertiary
  Period.</i>&mdash;But changes of a somewhat similar character have also
  taken place in America and the Pacific. An enormous area west of the
  Mississippi, extending over much of the Rocky Mountains, consists of
  marine Cretaceous beds 10,000 feet thick, indicating great and
  long-continued subsidence, and an insular condition of Western America
  with a sea probably extending northwards to the Arctic Ocean. As marine
  Tertiary deposits are found conformably overlying these Cretaceous
  strata, Professor Dana is of opinion that the great elevation of this
  part of America did not begin till early Tertiary times. Other Tertiary
  beds in California, Alaska, Kamschatka, the Mackenzie River, the Parry
  Islands, and Greenland, indicate partial submergence <!-- Page 195
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>{195}</span>of all these
  lands with the possible influx of warm water from the Pacific; and the
  considerable elevation of some of the Miocene beds in Greenland and
  Spitzbergen renders it probable that these countries were then much less
  elevated, in which case only their higher summits would be covered with
  perpetual snow, and no glaciers would descend to the sea.</p>

  <p>In the Pacific there was probably an elevation of land
  counterbalancing, to some extent, the great depression of so much of the
  northern continents. Our map in Chapter XV. shows the islands that would
  be produced by an elevation of the great shoals under a thousand fathoms
  deep, and it is seen that these all trend in a south-east and north-west
  direction, and would thus facilitate the production of definite currents
  impelled by the south-east trades towards the north-west Pacific, where
  they would gain access to the polar seas through Behring's Straits, which
  were, perhaps, sometimes both wider and deeper than at present.</p>

  <p><i>Effect of these Changes on the Climate of the Arctic
  Regions.</i>&mdash;These various changes of sea and land, all tending
  towards a transference of heat from the equator to the north temperate
  zone, were not improbably still further augmented by the existence of a
  great inland South American sea occupying what are now the extensive
  valleys of the Amazon and Orinoco, and forming an additional reservoir of
  super-heated water to add to the supply poured into the North
  Atlantic.</p>

  <p>It is not of course supposed that all the modifications here indicated
  co-existed at the same time. We have good reason to believe, from the
  known distribution of animals in the Tertiary period, that
  land-communications have at times existed between Europe or Asia and
  North America, either by way of Behring's Straits, or by Iceland,
  Greenland, and Labrador. But the same evidence shows that these
  land-communications were the exception rather than the rule, and that
  they occurred only at long intervals and for short periods, so as at no
  time to bring about anything like a complete interchange of the
  productions of the two continents.<a name="NtA_76"
  href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> We may therefore admit that the <!--
  Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page196"></a>{196}</span>communication between the tropical and
  Arctic oceans was occasionally interrupted in one or other direction; but
  if we look at a globe instead of a Mercator's chart of the world, we
  shall see that the disproportion between the extent of the polar and
  tropical seas is so enormous that a single wide opening, with an adequate
  impulse to carry in a considerable stream of warm water, would be amply
  sufficient for the complete abolition of polar snow and ice, when aided
  by the absence of any great areas of high land within the polar circle,
  such high land being, as we have seen, essential to the production of
  perpetual snow even at the present time.</p>

  <p>Those who wish to understand the effect of oceanic currents in
  conveying heat to the north temperate and polar regions, should study the
  papers of Dr. Croll already referred to. But the same thing is equally
  well shown by the facts of the actual distribution of heat due to the
  Gulf Stream. The difference between the mean annual temperatures of the
  opposite coasts of Europe and America is well known and has been already
  quoted, but the difference of their mean <i>winter</i> temperature is
  still more striking, and it is this which concerns us as more especially
  affecting the distribution of vegetable and animal life. Our mean winter
  temperature in the west of England is the same as that of the Southern
  United States, as well as that of Shanghai in China, both about twenty
  degrees of latitude further south; and as we go northward the difference
  increases, so that the winter climate of Nova Scotia in Lat. 45° is found
  within the Arctic circle on the coast of Norway; and if the latter
  country did not consist almost wholly of precipitous snow-clad mountains,
  it would be capable of supporting most of the vegetable products of the
  American coast in the latitude of Bordeaux.<a name="NtA_77"
  href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 197 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>{197}</span></p>

  <p>With these astounding facts before us, due wholly to the transference
  of a portion of the warm currents of the Atlantic to the shores of
  Europe, even with all the disadvantages of an icy sea to the north-east
  and ice-covered Greenland to the north-west, how can we doubt the
  enormously greater effect of such a condition of things as has been shown
  to have existed during the Tertiary epoch? Instead of <i>one</i> great
  stream of warm water spreading widely over the North Atlantic and thus
  losing the greater part of its store of heat <i>before</i> it reaches the
  Arctic seas, we should have <i>several</i> streams conveying the heat of
  far more extensive tropical oceans by comparatively narrow inland
  channels, thus being able to transfer a large proportion of their heat
  <i>into</i> the northern and Arctic seas. The heat that they gave out
  during the passage, instead of being widely dispersed by winds and much
  of it lost in the higher atmosphere, would directly ameliorate the
  climate of the continents they passed through, and prevent all
  accumulation of snow except on the loftiest mountains. The formation of
  ice in the Arctic seas would then be impossible; and the mild winter
  climate of the latitude of North <!-- Page 198 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page198"></a>{198}</span>Carolina, which by the
  Gulf Stream is transferred 20° northwards to our islands, might
  certainly, under the favourable conditions which prevailed during the
  Cretaceous, Eocene, and Miocene periods, have been carried another 20°
  north to Greenland and Spitzbergen; and this would bring about exactly
  the climate indicated by the fossil Arctic vegetation. For it must be
  remembered that the Arctic summers are, even now, really hotter than
  ours, and if the winter's cold were abolished and all ice-accumulation
  prevented, the high northern lands would be able to support a far more
  luxuriant summer vegetation than is possible in our unequal and cloudy
  climate.<a name="NtA_78" href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Effect of High Excentricity on the Warm Polar
  Climates.</i>&mdash;If the explanation of the cause of the glacial epoch
  given in the last chapter is a correct one, it will, I believe, follow
  that changes in the amount of excentricity will produce no important
  alteration of the climates of the temperate and Arctic zones so long as
  favourable geographical conditions, such as have been now sketched out,
  render the accumulation of ice impossible. The effect of a high
  excentricity in producing a glacial epoch was shown to be due to the
  capacity of snow and ice for storing up cold, and its singular power
  (when in large masses) of preserving itself unmelted under a hot sun by
  itself causing the interposition of a protective covering of cloud and
  vapour. But mobile currents of water have no such power of <!-- Page 199
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>{199}</span>accumulating
  and storing up heat or cold from one year to another, though they do in a
  pre-eminent degree possess the power of equalising the temperature of
  winter and summer and of conveying the superabundant heat of the tropics
  to ameliorate the rigour of the Arctic winters. However great was the
  difference between the amount of heat received from the sun in winter and
  summer in the Arctic zone during a period of high excentricity and winter
  in <i>aphelion</i>, the inequality would be greatly diminished by the
  free ingress of warm currents to the polar area; and if this was
  sufficient to prevent any accumulation of ice, the summers would be
  warmed to the full extent of the powers of the sun during the long polar
  day, which is such as to give the pole at midsummer actually more heat
  during the twenty-four hours than the equator receives during its day of
  twelve hours. The only difference, then, that would be directly produced
  by the changes of excentricity and precession would be, that the summers
  would be at one period almost tropical, at the other of a more mild and
  uniform temperate character; while the winters would be at one time
  somewhat longer and colder, but never, probably, more severe than they
  are now in the west of Scotland.</p>

  <p>But though high excentricity would not directly modify the mild
  climates produced by the state of the northern hemisphere which prevailed
  during Cretaceous, Eocene, and Miocene times, it might indirectly affect
  it by increasing the mass of Antarctic ice, and thus increasing the force
  of the trade-winds and the resulting northward-flowing warm currents. Now
  there are many peculiarities in the distribution of plants and of some
  groups of animals in the southern hemisphere, which render it almost
  certain that there has sometimes been a greater extension of the
  Antarctic lands during Tertiary times; and it is therefore not improbable
  that a more or less glaciated condition may have been a long persistent
  feature of the southern hemisphere, due to the peculiar distribution of
  land and sea which favours the production of ice-fields and glaciers. And
  as we have seen that during the last three million years the excentricity
  has been almost always much higher than <!-- Page 200 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>{200}</span>it is now, we should
  expect that the quantity of ice in the southern hemisphere will usually
  have been greater, and will thus have tended to increase the force of
  those oceanic currents which produce the mild climates of the northern
  hemisphere.</p>

  <p><i>Evidences of Climate in the Secondary and Palæozoic
  Epochs.</i>&mdash;We have already seen, that so far back as the
  Cretaceous period there is the most conclusive evidence of the prevalence
  of a very mild climate not only in temperate but also in Arctic lands,
  while there is no proof whatever, or even any clear indication, of early
  glacial epochs at all comparable in extent and severity with that which
  has so recently occurred; and we have seen reason to connect this state
  of things with a distribution of land and sea highly favourable to the
  transference of warm water from equatorial to polar latitudes. So far as
  we can judge by the plant-remains of our own country, the climate appears
  to have been almost tropical in the Lower Eocene period; and as we go
  further back we find no clear indications of a higher, but often of a
  lower temperature, though always warmer or more equable than our present
  climate. The abundant corals and reptiles of the Oolite and Lias indicate
  equally tropical conditions; but further back, in the Trias, the flora
  and fauna, in the <span class="correction" title="Original reads `Brittish'."
  >British</span> area, become poorer, and there is nothing incompatible
  with a climate no warmer than that of the Upper Miocene. This poverty is
  still more marked in the Permian formation, and it is here that some
  indications of ice-action are found in the Lower Permian conglomerates of
  the west of England. These beds contain abundant fragments of various
  rocks, often angular and sometimes weighing half a ton, while others are
  partially rounded, and have polished and striated surfaces, just like the
  stones of the "till." They lie confusedly bedded in a red unstratified
  marl, and some of them can be traced to the Welsh hills from twenty to
  fifty miles distant. This remarkable formation was first pointed out as
  proving a remote glacial period, by Professor Ramsay; and Sir Charles
  Lyell agreed that this is the only possible explanation that, with our
  present knowledge, we can give of them.</p>

  <p>Permian breccias are also found in Ireland, containing <!-- Page 201
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page201"></a>{201}</span>blocks of
  Silurian and Old Red sandstone rocks which Professor Hull believes could
  only have been carried by floating ice. Similar breccias occur in the
  south of Scotland, and these are stated to be "overlain by a deposit of
  glacial age, so similar to the breccia below as to be with difficulty
  distinguished from it."<a name="NtA_79"
  href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

  <p>These numerous physical indications of ice-action over a considerable
  area during the same geological period, coinciding with just such a
  poverty of organic remains as might be produced by a very cold climate,
  are very important, and seem clearly to indicate that at this remote
  period geographical conditions were such as to bring about a glacial
  epoch, or perhaps only local glaciation, in our part of the world.</p>

  <p>Boulder-beds also occur in the Carboniferous formation, both in
  Scotland, on the continent of Europe, and in North America; and Professor
  Dawson considers that he has detected true glacial deposits of the same
  age in Nova Scotia. Boulder-beds also occur in the Silurian rocks of
  Scotland and North America, and according to Professor Dawson, even in
  the Huronian, older than our Cambrian. None of these indications are
  however so satisfactory as those of Permian age, where we have the very
  kind of evidence we looked for in vain throughout the whole of the
  Tertiary and Secondary periods. Its presence in several localities in
  such ancient rocks as the Permian is not only most important as
  indicating a glacial epoch of some kind in Palæozoic times, but confirms
  us in the validity of our conclusion, that the <i>total</i> absence of
  any such evidence throughout the Tertiary and Secondary epochs
  demonstrates the absence of recurring glacial epochs in the northern
  hemisphere, notwithstanding the frequent recurrence of periods of high
  excentricity.</p>

  <p><i>Warm Arctic Climates in Early Secondary and Palæozoic
  Times.</i>&mdash;The evidence we have already adduced of the mild
  climates prevailing in the Arctic regions throughout the Miocene, Eocene,
  and Cretaceous periods is supplemented by a considerable body of facts
  relating to still earlier epochs.</p>

<p><!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>{202}</span></p>

  <p>In the Jurassic period, for example, we have proofs of a mild Arctic
  climate, in the abundant plant-remains of East Siberia and Amurland, with
  less productive deposits in Spitzbergen, and at Ando in Norway just
  within the Arctic circle. But even more remarkable are the marine remains
  found in many places in high northern latitudes, among which we may
  especially mention the numerous ammonites and the vertebræ of huge
  reptiles of the genera Ichthyosaurus and Teleosaurus found in the
  Jurassic deposits of the Parry Islands in 77° N. Lat.</p>

  <p>In the still earlier Triassic age, nautili and ammonites inhabited the
  seas of Spitzbergen, where their fossil remains are now found.</p>

  <p>In the Carboniferous formation we again meet with plant-remains and
  beds of true coal in the Arctic regions. Lepidodendrons and Calamites,
  together with large spreading ferns, are found at Spitzbergen, and at
  Bear Island in the extreme north of Eastern Siberia; while marine
  deposits of the same age contain abundance of large stony corals.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the ancient Silurian limestones, which are widely spread in
  the high Arctic regions, contain abundance of corals and cephalopodous
  mollusca resembling those from the same deposits in more temperate
  lands.</p>

  <p><i>Conclusions as to the Climates of Tertiary and Secondary
  Periods.</i>&mdash;If now we look at the whole series of geological facts
  as to the animal and vegetable productions of the Arctic regions in past
  ages, it is certainly difficult to avoid the conclusion that they
  indicate a climate of a uniformly temperate or warm character. Whether in
  Miocene, Upper or Lower Cretaceous, Jurassic, Triassic, Carboniferous or
  Silurian times, and in all the numerous localities extending over more
  than half the polar regions, we find one uniform climatic aspect in the
  fossils. This is quite inconsistent with the theory of alternate cold and
  mild epochs during phases of high excentricity, and persistent cold
  epochs when the excentricity was as low as it is now or lower, for that
  would imply that the duration of cold conditions was <i>greater</i> than
  that of warm. Why then should the fauna and flora of the cold epochs
  <i>never</i> be <!-- Page 203 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page203"></a>{203}</span>preserved? Mollusca and many other forms
  of life are abundant in the Arctic seas, and there is often a luxuriant
  dwarf woody vegetation on the land, yet in no one case has a single
  example of such a fauna or flora been discovered of a date anterior to
  the last glacial epoch. And this argument is very much strengthened when
  we remember that an exactly analogous series of facts is found over all
  the temperate zones. Everywhere we have abundant floras and faunas
  indicating warmer conditions than such as now prevail, but never in a
  single instance one which as clearly indicates colder conditions. The
  fact that drift with Arctic shells was deposited during the last glacial
  epoch, as well as gravels and crag with the remains of arctic animals and
  plants, shows us that there is nothing to prevent such deposits being
  formed in cold as well as in warm periods; and it is quite impossible to
  believe that in every place and at all epochs all records of the former
  have been destroyed, while in a considerable number of instances those of
  the latter have been preserved. When to this uniform testimony of the
  palæontological evidence we add the equally uniform absence of any
  indication of those ice-borne rocks, boulders, and drift, which are the
  constant and necessary accompaniment of every period of glaciation, and
  which must inevitably pervade all the marine deposits formed over a wide
  area so long as the state of glaciation continues, we are driven to the
  conclusion that the last glacial epoch of the northern hemisphere was
  exceptional, and was not preceded by numerous similar glacial epochs
  throughout Tertiary and Secondary time.</p>

  <p>But although glacial epochs (with the one or two exceptions already
  referred to) were certainly absent, considerable changes of climate may
  have frequently occurred, and these would lead to important changes in
  the organic world. We can hardly doubt that some such change occurred
  between the Lower and Upper Cretaceous periods, the floras of which
  exhibit such an extraordinary contrast in general character. We have also
  the testimony of Mr. J.&nbsp;S. Gardner, who has long worked at the fossil
  floras of the Tertiary deposits, and who states, that <!-- Page 204
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>{204}</span>there is
  strong negative and some positive evidence of alternating warmer and
  colder conditions, not glacial, contained not only in English Eocene, but
  all Tertiary beds throughout the world.<a name="NtA_80"
  href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> In the case of marine faunas it is more
  difficult to judge, but the numerous changes in the fossil remains from
  bed to bed only a few feet and sometimes a few inches apart, may be
  sometimes due to change of climate; and when it is recognised that such
  changes have probably occurred at all geological epochs and their effects
  are systematically searched for, many peculiarities in the distribution
  of organisms through the different members of one deposit may be traced
  to this cause.</p>

  <p><i>General View of Geological Climates as dependent on the Physical
  Features of the Earth's Surface.</i>&mdash;In the preceding chapters I
  have earnestly endeavoured to arrive at an explanation of geological
  climates in the temperate and Arctic zones, which should be in harmony
  with the great body of geological facts now available for their
  elucidation. If my conclusions as here set forth diverge considerably
  from those of Dr. Croll, it is not from any want of appreciation of his
  facts and arguments, since for many years I have upheld and enforced his
  views to the best of my ability. But a careful re-examination of the
  whole question has now convinced me that an error has been made in
  estimating the comparative effect of geographical and astronomical causes
  on changes of climate, and that, while the latter have undoubtedly played
  an important part in bringing about the glacial epoch, it is to the
  former that the mild climates of the Arctic regions are almost entirely
  due. If I have now succeeded in approaching to a true solution of this
  difficult problem, I owe it mainly to the study of Dr. Croll's writings,
  since my theory is entirely based on the facts and principles so clearly
  set forth in his admirable papers on "Ocean Currents in relation to the
  Distribution of Heat over the Globe." The main features of this theory as
  distinct from that of Dr. Croll I will now endeavour to summarise.</p>

  <p>Looking at the subject broadly, we see that the climatic <!-- Page 205
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205"></a>{205}</span>condition of
  the northern hemisphere is the result of the peculiar distribution of
  land and water upon the globe; and the general permanence of the position
  of the continental and oceanic areas&mdash;which we have shown to be
  proved by so many distinct lines of evidence&mdash;is also implied by the
  general stability of climate throughout long geological periods. The land
  surface of our earth appears to have always consisted of three great
  masses in the north temperate zone, narrowing southward, and terminating
  in three comparatively narrow extremities represented by Southern
  America, South Africa, and Australia. Towards the north these masses have
  approached each other, and have sometimes become united; leaving beyond
  them a considerable area of open polar sea. Towards the south they have
  never been much further prolonged than at present, but far beyond their
  extremities an extensive mass of land has occupied the south polar
  area.</p>

  <p>This arrangement is such as would cause the northern hemisphere to be
  always (as it is now) warmer than the southern, and this would lead to
  the preponderance of northward winds and ocean currents, and would bring
  about the concentration of the latter in three great streams carrying
  warmth to the north-polar regions. These streams would, as Dr. Croll has
  so well shown, be greatly increased in power by the glaciation of the
  south polar land; and whenever any considerable portion of this land was
  elevated, such a condition of glaciation would certainly be brought
  about, and would be heightened whenever a high degree of excentricity
  prevailed.</p>

  <p>It is now the general opinion of geologists that the great continents
  have undergone a process of development from earlier to later times.
  Professor Dana appears to have been the first who taught it explicitly in
  the case of the North American continent, and he has continued the
  development of his views from 1856, when he discussed the subject in the
  <i>American Journal</i>, to the later editions of his <i>Manual of
  Geology</i> in which the same views are extended to all the great
  continents. He says:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The North American continent, which since early <!-- Page 206
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>{206}</span>time had been
  gradually expanding in each direction from the northern Azoic, eastward,
  westward, and southward, and which, after the Palæozoic, was finished in
  its rocky foundation, excepting on the borders of the Atlantic and
  Pacific and the area of the Rocky Mountains, had reached its full
  expansion at the close of the Tertiary period. The progress from the
  first was uniform and systematic: the land was at all times simple in
  outline; and its enlargement took place with almost the regularity of an
  exogenous plant."<a name="NtA_81" href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A similar development undoubtedly took place in the European area,
  which was apparently never so compact and so little interpenetrated by
  the sea as it is now, while Europe and Asia have only become united into
  one unbroken mass since late Tertiary times.</p>

  <p>If, however, the greater continents have become more compact and
  massive from age to age, and have received their chief extensions
  northward at a comparatively recent period, while the Antarctic lands had
  a corresponding but somewhat earlier development, we have all the
  conditions requisite to explain the persistence, with slight
  fluctuations, of warm climates far into the north-polar area throughout
  Palæozoic, Mesozoic, and Tertiary times. At length, during the latter
  part of the Tertiary epoch, a considerable elevation took place, closing
  up several of the water passages to the north, and raising up extensive
  areas in the Arctic regions to become the receptacle of snow and
  ice-fields. This elevation is indicated by the abundance of Miocene and
  the absence of Pliocene deposits in the Arctic zone and the considerable
  altitude of many Miocene rocks in Europe and North America; and the
  occurrence at this time of a long-continued period of high excentricity
  necessarily brought on the glacial epoch in the manner already described
  in our last chapter. A depression seems to have occurred during the
  glacial period itself in North America as in Britain, but this may have
  been due partly to the weight of the ice and partly to a rise of the
  ocean <!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page207"></a>{207}</span>level caused by the earth's centre of
  gravity being shifted towards the north.</p>

  <p>We thus see that the last glacial epoch was the climax of a great
  process of continental development which had been going on throughout
  long geological ages; and that it was the direct consequence of the north
  temperate and polar land having attained a great extension and a
  considerable altitude just at the time when a phase of very high
  excentricity was coming on. Throughout earlier Tertiary and Secondary
  times an equally high excentricity often occurred, but it never produced
  a glacial epoch, because the north temperate and polar areas had less
  high land, and were more freely open to the influx of warm oceanic
  currents. But wherever great plateaux with lofty mountains occurred in
  the temperate zone a considerable <i>local</i> glaciation might be
  produced, which would be specially intense during periods of high
  excentricity; and it is to such causes we must impute the indications of
  ice-action in the vicinity of the Alps during the Tertiary period. The
  Permian glaciation appears to have been more extensive, and it is quite
  possible that at this remote epoch a sufficient mass of high land existed
  in our area and northwards towards the pole, to have brought on a true
  glacial period comparable with that which has so recently passed
  away.</p>

  <p><i>Estimate of the comparative effects of Geographical and
  Astronomical Causes in producing Changes of Climate.</i>&mdash;It appears
  then, that while geographical and physical causes alone, by their
  influence on ocean currents, have been the main agents in producing the
  mild climates which for such long periods prevailed in the Arctic
  regions, the concurrence of astronomical causes&mdash;high excentricity
  with winter in <i>aphelion</i>&mdash;was necessary to the production of
  the great glacial epoch. If we reject this latter agency, we shall be
  obliged to imagine a concurrence of geographical changes at a very recent
  period of which we have no evidence. We must suppose, for example, that a
  large part of the British Isles&mdash;Scotland, Ireland, and Wales at all
  events&mdash;were simultaneously elevated so as to bring extensive areas
  above the line of perpetual snow; that <!-- Page 208 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page208"></a>{208}</span>about the same time
  Scandinavia, the Alps, and the Pyrenees received a similar increase of
  altitude; and that, almost simultaneously, Eastern North America, the
  Sierra Nevada of California, the Caucasus, Lebanon, the southern
  mountains of Spain, the Atlas range, and the Himalayas, were each some
  thousands of feet higher than they are now; for all these mountains
  present us with indications of a recent extension of their glaciers, in
  superficial phenomena so similar to those which occur in our own country
  and in Western Europe, that we cannot suppose them to belong to a
  different epoch. Such a supposition is rendered more difficult by the
  general concurrence of scientific testimony to a partial submergence
  during the glacial epoch, not only in all parts of Britain, but in North
  America, Scandinavia, and, as shown by the wide extension of the drift,
  in Northern Europe; and when to this we add the difficulty of
  understanding how any probable addition to the altitude of our islands
  could have brought about the extreme amount of glaciation which they
  certainly underwent, and when, further, we know that a phase of very high
  excentricity did occur at a period which is generally admitted to agree
  well with physical evidence of the time elapsed since the cold passed
  away, there seems no sufficient reason why such an agency should be
  ignored.</p>

  <p>No doubt a prejudice has been excited against it in the minds of many
  geologists, by its being thought to lead <i>necessarily</i> to frequently
  recurring glacial epochs throughout all geological time. But I have here
  endeavoured to show that this is <i>not</i> a necessary consequence of
  the theory, because a concurrence of favourable geographical conditions
  is essential to the initiation of a glaciation, which when once initiated
  has a tendency to maintain itself throughout the varying phases of
  precession occurring during a period of high excentricity. When, however,
  geographical conditions favour warm Arctic climates&mdash;as it has been
  shown they have done throughout the larger portion of geological
  time&mdash;then changes of excentricity, to however great an extent, have
  no tendency to bring about a state of glaciation, because warm oceanic
  currents have a <!-- Page 209 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page209"></a>{209}</span>preponderating influence, and without very
  large areas of high northern land to act as condensers, no perpetual snow
  is possible, and hence the initial process of glaciation does not
  occur.</p>

  <p>The theory as now set forth should commend itself to geologists, since
  it shows the direct dependence of climate on physical processes, which
  are guided and modified by those changes in the earth's surface which
  geology alone can trace out. It is in perfect accord with the most recent
  teachings of the science as to the gradual and progressive development of
  the earth's crust from the rudimentary formations of the Azoic age, and
  it lends support to the view that no inportant[**important] departure
  from the great lines of elevation and depression originally marked out on
  the earth's surface has ever taken place.</p>

  <p>It also shows us how important an agent in the production of a
  habitable globe with comparatively small extremes of climates over its
  whole area, is the great disproportion between the extent of the land and
  the water surfaces. For if these proportions had been reversed, large
  areas of land would necessarily have been removed from the beneficial
  influence of aqueous currents or moisture-laden winds; and slight
  geological changes might easily have led to half the land surface
  becoming covered with perpetual snow and ice, or being exposed to
  extremes of summer heat and winter cold, of which our water-permeated
  globe at present affords no example. We thus see that what are usually
  regarded as geographical anomalies&mdash;the disproportion of land and
  water, the gathering of the land mainly into one hemisphere, and the
  singular arrangement of the land in three great southward-pointing
  masses&mdash;are really facts of the greatest significance and
  importance, since it is to these very anomalies that the universal spread
  of vegetation and the adaptability of so large a portion of the earth's
  surface for human habitation is directly due.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The subjects discussed in the last three chapters introduce us to a
  difficulty which has hitherto been considered a very formidable
  one&mdash;that the maximum age of the habitable earth, as deduced from
  physical considerations, does not afford sufficient time either for the
  geological or the organic changes of which we have evidence. Geologists
  continually dwell on the slowness of the processes of upheaval and
  subsidence, of denudation of the earth's surface, and of the formation of
  new strata; while on the theory of development, as expounded by Mr.
  Darwin, the variation and modification of organic forms is also a very
  slow process, and has usually been considered to require an <!-- Page 211
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211"></a>{211}</span>even longer
  series of ages than might satisfy the requirements of physical geology
  alone.</p>

  <p>As an indication of the periods usually contemplated by geologists, we
  may refer to Sir Charles Lyell's calculation in the tenth edition of his
  <i>Principles of Geology</i> (omitted in later editions), by which he
  arrived at 240 millions of years as having probably elapsed since the
  Cambrian period&mdash;a very moderate estimate in the opinion of most
  geologists. This calculation was founded on the rate of modification of
  the species of mollusca; but much more recently Professor Haughton has
  arrived at nearly similar figures from a consideration of the rate of
  formation of rocks and their known maximum thickness, whence he deduces a
  maximum of 200 millions of years for the whole duration of geological
  time, as indicated by the series of stratified formations.<a
  name="NtA_82" href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> But in the opinion of all
  our first naturalists and geologists, the period occupied in the
  formation of the known stratified rocks only represents a portion, and
  perhaps a small portion, of geological time. In the sixth edition of the
  <i>Origin of Species</i> (p. 286), Mr. Darwin says: "Consequently, if the
  theory be true, it is indisputable that before the lowest Cambrian
  stratum was deposited long periods elapsed, as long as, or probably far
  longer than, the whole interval from the Cambrian age to the present day;
  and that during these vast periods the world swarmed with living
  creatures." Professor Huxley, in his anniversary address to the
  Geological Society in 1870, adduced a number of special cases showing
  that, on the theory of development, almost all the higher forms of life
  must have existed during the Palæozoic period. Thus, from the fact that
  almost the whole of the Tertiary period has been required to convert the
  ancestral Orohippus into the true horse, he believes that, in order to
  have time for the much greater change of the ancestral Ungulata into the
  two great odd-toed and even-toed divisions (of which change there is no
  trace even among the earliest Eocene mammals), we should require a large
  portion, if not the whole, of the Mesozoic or Secondary period. Another
  case is furnished by the bats and whales, both of which strange
  modifications of the <!-- Page 212 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page212"></a>{212}</span>mammalian type occur perfectly developed
  in the Eocene formation. What countless ages back must we then go for the
  origin of these groups, the whales from some ancestral carnivorous
  animal, and the bats from the insectivora! And even then we have to seek
  for the common origin of carnivora, insectivora, ungulata, and marsupials
  at a far earlier period; so that, on the lowest estimate, we must place
  the origin of the mammalia very far back in Palæozoic times. Similar
  evidence is afforded by reptiles, of which Professor Huxley says: "If the
  very small differences which are observable between the crocodiles of the
  older Secondary formations and those of the present day furnish any sort
  of an approximation towards an estimate of the average rate of change
  among reptiles, it is almost appalling to reflect how far back in
  Palæozoic times we must go before we can hope to arrive at that common
  stock from which the crocodiles, lizards, <i>Ornithoscelida</i>, and
  <i>Plesiosauria</i>, which had attained so great a development in the
  Triassic epoch, must have been derived." Professor Ramsay has expressed
  similar views, derived from a general study of the whole series of
  geological formations and their contained fossils. He says, speaking of
  the abundant, varied, and well-developed fauna of the Cambrian period:
  "In this earliest known <i>varied</i> life we find no evidence of its
  having lived near the beginning of the zoological series. In a broad
  sense, compared with what must have gone before, both biologically and
  physically, all the phenomena connected with this old period seem, to my
  mind, to be of quite a recent description; and the climates of seas and
  lands were of the very same kind as those the world enjoys at the present
  day."<a name="NtA_83" href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

  <p>These opinions, and the facts on which they are founded, are so
  weighty, that we can hardly doubt that, if the time since the Cambrian
  epoch is correctly estimated at 200 millions of years, the date of the
  commencement of life on the earth cannot be much less than 500 millions;
  while it may not improbably have been longer, because the reaction of
  <!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page213"></a>{213}</span>the organism under changes of the
  environment is believed to have been less active in low and simple, than
  in high and complex forms of life, and thus the processes of organic
  development may for countless ages have been excessively slow.</p>

  <p>But according to the physicists, no such periods as are here
  contemplated can be granted. From a consideration of the possible sources
  of the heat of the sun, as well as from calculations of the period during
  which the earth can have been cooling to bring about the present rate of
  increase of temperature as we descend beneath the surface, Sir William
  Thomson concludes that the crust of the earth cannot have been solidified
  much longer than 100 million years (the maximum possible being 400
  millions), and this conclusion is held by Dr. Croll and other men of
  eminence to be almost indisputable.<a name="NtA_84"
  href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> It will therefore be well to consider
  on what data the calculations of geologists have been founded, and how
  far the views here set forth, as to frequent changes of climate
  throughout all geological time, may affect the rate of biological
  change.</p>

  <p><i>Denudation and Deposition of Strata as a Measure of
  Time.</i>&mdash;The materials of all the stratified rocks of the globe
  have been obtained from the dry land. Every point of the surface is
  exposed to the destructive influences of sun and wind, frost, snow, and
  rain, which break up and wear away the hardest rocks as well as the
  softer deposits, and by means of rivers convey the worn material to the
  sea. The existence of a considerable depth of soil over the greater part
  of the earth's surface; of vast heaps of rocky <i>débris</i> at the foot
  of every inland cliff; of enormous deposits of gravel, sand, and loam; as
  well as the shingle, pebbles, sand or mud, of every sea-shore, alike
  attest the universality of this destructive agency. It is no less clearly
  shown by the way in which almost every drop of running
  water&mdash;whether in gutter, brooklet, stream or large
  river&mdash;becomes discoloured after each heavy rainfall, since the
  matter which causes this discolouration must be derived from the surface
  <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page214"></a>{214}</span>of the country, must always pass from a
  higher to a lower level, and must ultimately reach the sea, unless it is
  first deposited in some lake, or by the overflowing of a river goes to
  form an alluvial plain. The universality of this subaërial denudation,
  both as regards space and time, renders it certain that its cumulative
  effects must be very great; but no attempt seems to have been made to
  determine the magnitude of these effects till Mr. Alfred Tylor, in
  1853,<a name="NtA_85" href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> pointed out that
  by measuring the quantity of solid matter brought down by rivers (which
  can be done with considerable accuracy), we may obtain the amount of
  lowering of the land-area, and also the rise of the ocean level, owing to
  the quantity of matter deposited on its floor. A few years later Dr.
  Croll applied the same method in more detail to an estimate of the amount
  by which the land is lowered in a given period; and the validity of this
  method has been upheld by Sir A. Geikie, Sir Charles Lyell, and all our
  best geologists, as affording a means of actually determining with some
  approach to accuracy, the time occupied by one important phase of
  geological change.</p>

  <p>The quantity of matter carried away from the land by a river is
  greater than at first sight appears, and is more likely to be under- than
  over-estimated. By taking samples of water near the mouth of a river (but
  above the influence of the tide) at a sufficient number of points in its
  channel and at different depths, and repeating this daily or at other
  short intervals throughout the year, it is easy to determine the quantity
  of solid matter held in suspension and solution; and if corresponding
  observations determine the quantity of water that is discharged, the
  total amount of solid matter brought down annually may be calculated. But
  besides this, a considerable quantity of sand or even gravel is carried
  along the bottom or bed of the river, and this has rarely been estimated,
  so that the figures hitherto obtained are usually under the real
  quantities. There is also another source of error caused by the quantity
  of matter the river may deposit in lakes or in flooded lands during its
  course, for this adds to the amount of denudation performed by the river,
  although <!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page215"></a>{215}</span>the matter so deposited does not come down
  to the sea. After a careful examination of all the best records, Sir A.
  Geikie arrives at the following results, as to the quantity of matter
  removed by seven rivers from their basins, estimated by the number of
  years required to lower the whole surface an average of one foot:</p>

  <p>Here we see an intelligible relation between the character of the
  river basin and the amount of denudation. The Mississippi has a large
  portion of its basin in an arid country, and its sources are either in
  forest-clad plateaux or in mountains free from glaciers and with a scanty
  rainfall. The Danube flows through Eastern Europe where the rainfall is
  considerably less than in the west, while comparatively few of its
  tributaries rise among the loftiest Alps. The proportionate amounts of
  denudation being then what we might expect, and as all are probably under
  rather than over the truth, we may safely take the average of them all as
  representing an amount of denudation which, if not true for the whole
  land surface of the globe, will certainly be so for a very considerable
  proportion of it. This average is almost exactly one foot in three
  thousand years.<a name="NtA_86" href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> The
  mean altitude of the several <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page216"></a>{216}</span>continents has been recently estimated by
  Mr. John Murray,<a name="NtA_87" href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> to be
  as follows: Europe 939 feet, Asia 3,189 feet, Africa 2020 feet, North
  America 1,888 feet, and South America 2,078 feet. At the rate of
  denudation above given, it results that, were no other forces at work,
  Europe would be planed down to the sea-level in about two million eight
  hundred thousand years; while if we take a somewhat slower rate for North
  America, that continent might last about four or five million years.<a
  name="NtA_88" href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> This also implies that
  the mean height of these continents would have been about double what it
  is now three million and five million years ago respectively: and as we
  have no reason to suppose this to have been the case, we are led to infer
  the constant action of that upheaving force which the presence of
  sedimentary formations even on the highest mountains also
  demonstrates.</p>

  <p>We have already discussed the unequal rate of denudation on hills,
  valleys, and lowlands, in connection with the evidence of remote glacial
  epochs (p. 173); what we have now to consider is, what becomes of all
  this denuded matter, and how far the known rate of denudation affords us
  a measure of the rate of deposition, and thus gives us some indication of
  the lapse of geological time from a comparison of this rate with the
  observed thickness of stratified rocks on the earth's surface.</p>

<p><!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217"></a>{217}</span></p>

  <p><i>How to Estimate the Thickness of the Sedimentary
  Rocks.</i>&mdash;The sedimentary rocks of which the earth's crust is
  mainly composed consist, according to Sir Charles Lyell's classification,
  of fourteen great formations, of which the most ancient is the
  Laurentian, and the most recent the Post-Tertiary or Pleistocene; with
  thirty important subdivisions, each of which again consists of a more or
  less considerable number of distinct beds or strata. Thus, the Silurian
  formation is divided into Upper and Lower Silurian, each characterized by
  a distinct set of fossil remains, and the Upper Silurian again consists
  of a large number of separate beds, such as the Wenlock Limestone, the
  Upper Llandovery Sandstone the Lower Llandovery Slates, &amp;c., each
  usually characterised by a difference of mineral composition or
  mechanical structure, as well as by some peculiar fossils. These beds and
  formations vary greatly in extent, both above and beneath the surface,
  and are also of very various thicknesses in different localities. A thick
  bed or series of beds often thins out in a given direction, and sometimes
  disappears altogether, so that two beds which were respectively above and
  beneath it may come into contact. As an example of this thinning out,
  American geologists adduce the Palæozoic formations of the Appalachian
  Mountains, which have a total thickness of 42,000 feet, but as they are
  traced westward thin out till they become only 4,000 feet in total
  thickness. In like manner the Carboniferous grits and shales are 18,000
  feet thick in Yorkshire and Lancashire, but they thin out southwards, so
  that in Leicestershire they are only 3,000 feet thick; and similar
  phenomena occur in all strata and in every part of the world. It must be
  observed that this thinning out has nothing to do with denudation (which
  acts upon the surface of a country so as to produce great irregularities
  of contour), but is a regular attenuation of the layers of rock, due to a
  deficiency of sediment in certain directions at the original formation of
  the deposit. Owing to this thinning out of stratified rocks, they are on
  the whole of far less extent than is usually supposed. When we see a
  geological map showing successive formations following each other in long
  irregular belts across the country (as is well <!-- Page 218 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>{218}</span>seen in the case of the
  Secondary rocks of England), and a corresponding section showing each bed
  dipping beneath its predecessor, we are apt to imagine that beneath the
  uppermost bed we should find all the others following in succession like
  the coats of an onion. But this is far from being the case, and a
  remarkable proof of the narrow limitation of these formations has been
  recently obtained by a boring at Ware through the Chalk and Gault Clay,
  which latter immediately rests on the Upper Silurian Wenlock Limestone
  full of characteristic fossils, at a depth of only 800 feet. Here we have
  an enormous gap, showing that none of earlier Secondary or late Palæozoic
  formations extend to this part of England, unless indeed they had been
  all once elevated and entirely swept away by denudation.<a name="NtA_89"
  href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But if we consider how such deposits are now forming, we shall find
  that the thinning out of the beds of each formation, and their
  restriction to irregular bands and patches, is exactly what we should
  expect. The enormous quantity of sediment continually poured into the sea
  by rivers, gradually subsides to the bottom as soon as the motion of the
  water is checked. All the heavier material must be deposited near the
  shore or in those areas over which it is first spread by the tides or
  currents of the ocean; while only the very fine mud and clay is carried
  out to considerable distances. Thus all stratified deposits <!-- Page 219
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219"></a>{219}</span>will form most
  quickly near the shores, and will thin out rapidly at greater distances,
  little or none being formed in the depths of the great oceans. This
  important fact was demonstrated by the specimens of sea-bottom examined
  during the voyage of the <i>Challenger</i>, all the "shore deposits"
  being usually confined within a distance of 100 or 150 miles from the
  coast; while the "deep-sea deposits" are either purely organic, being
  formed of the calcareous or siliceous skeletons of globigerinæ,
  radiolarians, and diatomaceæ, or are clays formed of undissolved portions
  of these, together with the disintegrated or dissolved materials of
  pumice and volcanic dust, which being very light are carried by wind or
  by water over the widest oceans.</p>

  <p>From the preceding considerations we shall be better able to
  appreciate the calculations as to the thickness of stratified deposits
  made by geologists. Professor Ramsay has calculated that the sedimentary
  rocks of Britain alone have a total <i>maximum</i> thickness of 72,600
  feet; while Professor Haughton, from a survey of the whole world,
  estimates the <i>maximum</i> thickness of the known stratified rocks at
  177,200 feet. Now these <i>maximum</i> thicknesses of each deposit will
  have been produced only where the conditions were exceptionally
  favourable, either in deep water near the mouths of great rivers, or in
  inland seas, or in places to which the drainage of extensive countries
  was conveyed by ocean currents; and this great thickness will necessarily
  be accompanied by a corresponding thinness, or complete absence of
  deposit, elsewhere. How far the series of rocks found in any extensive
  area, as Europe or North America, represents the whole series of deposits
  which have been made there we cannot tell; but there is no reason to
  think that it is a very inadequate representation of their <i>maximum</i>
  thickness, though it undoubtedly is of their <i>extent</i> and
  <i>bulk</i>. When we see in how many distinct localities patches of the
  same formation occur, it seems improbable that the whole of the deposits
  formed during any one period should have been destroyed, even in such an
  area as Europe, while it is still more improbable that they should be so
  destroyed over the whole world; and <!-- Page 220 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page220"></a>{220}</span>if any considerable
  portion of them is left, that portion may give a fair idea of their
  average, or even of their maximum, thickness. In his admirable paper on
  "The Mean Thickness of the Sedimentary Rocks,"<a name="NtA_90"
  href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> Dr. James Croll has dwelt on the extent
  of denudation in diminishing the mean thickness of the rocks that have
  been formed, remarking, "Whatever the present mean thickness of all the
  sedimentary rocks of our globe may be, it must be small in comparison to
  the mean thickness of all the sedimentary rocks which have been formed.
  This is obvious from the fact that the sedimentary rocks of one age are
  partly formed from the destruction of the sedimentary rocks of former
  ages. From the Laurentian age down to the present day the stratified
  rocks have been undergoing constant denudation." This is perfectly true,
  and yet the mean thickness of that portion of the sedimentary rocks which
  remains may not be very different from that of the entire mass, because
  denudation acts only on those rocks which are exposed on the surface of a
  country, and most largely on those that are upheaved; while, except in
  the rare case of an extensive formation being <i>quite horizontal</i>,
  and wholly exposed to the sea or to the atmosphere, denudation can have
  no tendency to diminish the thickness of any entire deposit.<a
  name="NtA_91" href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> Unless, therefore, a
  formation is completely destroyed by denudation in every part of the
  world (a thing very improbable), we may have in existing rocks a not very
  inadequate representation of the <i>mean thickness</i> of all that have
  been formed, and even of the <i>maximum</i> thickness of the larger
  portion. This will be the more likely because it is almost certain that
  many rocks contemporaneously formed are counted by geologists as distinct
  formations, whenever they differ in lithological character or in organic
  remains. But we know that limestones, sandstones, and shales, are always
  forming at the same time; <!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page221"></a>{221}</span>while a great difference in organic
  remains may arise from comparatively slight changes of geographical
  features, or from difference in the depth or purity of the water in which
  the animals lived.<a name="NtA_92" href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>How to Estimate the Average Rate of Deposition of the Sedimentary
  Rocks.</i>&mdash;But if we take the estimate of Professor Haughton
  (177,200 feet), which, as we have seen, is probably excessive, for the
  maximum thickness of the sedimentary rocks of the globe of all known
  geological ages, can we arrive at any estimate of the rate at which they
  were formed? Dr. Croll has attempted to make such an estimate, but he has
  taken for his basis the <i>mean</i> thickness of the rocks, which we have
  no means whatever of arriving at, and which he guesses, allowing for
  denudation, to be equal to the <i>maximum</i> thickness as measured by
  geologists. The land-area of the globe is, according to Dr. Croll,
  57,000,000<a name="NtA_93" href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> square
  miles, and he gives the coast-line as 116,000 miles. This, however, is,
  for our purpose, rather too much, as it allows for bays, inlets, and the
  smaller islands. An approximate measurement on a globe shows that 100,000
  miles will be nearer the mark, and this has the advantage of being an
  easily remembered even number. The distance from the coast, to which
  shore-deposits usually extend, may be reckoned at about 100 or 150 miles,
  but by far the larger portion of the matter brought down from the land
  will be deposited comparatively close to the shore; that is, within
  twenty or thirty miles. If we suppose the portion deposited beyond thirty
  miles to be added to the deposits within that distance, and the whole
  reduced to a uniform thickness in a direction at right angles to the
  coast, we should probably include all areas where deposits of the maximum
  thickness <!-- Page 222 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page222"></a>{222}</span>are forming at the present time, along
  with a large but unknown proportion of surface where the deposits were
  far below the maximum thickness. This follows, if we consider that
  deposit must go on very unequally along different parts of a coast, owing
  to the distance from each other of the mouths of great rivers and the
  limitations of ocean currents; and because, compared with the areas over
  which a thick deposit is forming annually, those where there is little or
  none are probably at least twice as extensive. If, therefore, we take a
  width of thirty miles along the whole coast-line of the globe as
  representing the area over which deposits are forming, corresponding to
  the maximum thickness as measured by geologists, we shall certainly over
  rather than under-estimate the possible rate of deposit.<a name="NtA_94"
  href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Now a coast line of 100,000 miles with a width of 30 gives an area of
  3,000,000 square miles, on which the denuded matter of the whole
  land-area of 57,000,000 square <!-- Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page223"></a>{223}</span>miles is deposited. As these two areas are
  as 1 to 19, it follows that deposition, as measured by <i>maximum</i>
  thickness, goes on at least nineteen times as fast as
  denudation&mdash;probably very much faster. But the mean rate of
  denudation over the whole earth is about one foot in three thousand
  years; therefore the rate of maximum deposition will be at least 19 feet
  in the same time; and as the total maximum thickness of all the
  stratified rocks of the globe is, according to Professor Haughton,
  177,200 feet, the time required to produce this thickness of rock, at the
  present rate of denudation and deposition, is only 28,000,000 years.<a
  name="NtA_95" href="#Nt_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>The Rate of Geological Change Probably Greater in very Remote
  Times.</i>&mdash;The opinion that denudation and deposition went on more
  rapidly in earlier times owing to the frequent occurrence of vast
  convulsions and cataclysms was strenuously opposed by Sir Charles Lyell,
  who so well showed that causes of the very same nature as those now in
  action were sufficient to account for all the phenomena presented by the
  rocks throughout the whole series of geological formations. But while
  upholding the soundness of the views of the "uniformitarians" as opposed
  to the "convulsionists," we must yet admit that there is reason for
  believing in a gradually increasing intensity of all telluric action as
  we go back into past time. This subject has been well treated by Mr.
  W.&nbsp;J. Sollas,<a name="NtA_96" href="#Nt_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> who shows
  that, if, as all physicists maintain, the sun gave out perceptibly more
  heat in past ages than now, this alone would cause an increase in almost
  all the forces that have brought about geological phenomena. With greater
  heat there would be a more extensive aqueous atmosphere, and, perhaps, a
  greater difference between equatorial and polar temperatures; hence more
  violent winds, heavier rains and snows, <!-- Page 224 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page224"></a>{224}</span>and more powerful
  oceanic currents, all producing more rapid denudation. At the same time,
  the internal heat of the earth being greater, it would be cooling more
  rapidly, and thus the forces of contraction&mdash;which cause the
  upheaving of mountains, the eruption of volcanoes, and the subsidence of
  extensive areas&mdash;would be more powerful and would still further aid
  the process of denudation. Yet again, the earth's rotation was certainly
  more rapid in very remote times, and this would cause more impetuous
  tides and still further add to the denuding power of the ocean. It thus
  appears that, as we go back into the past, <i>all</i> the forces tending
  to the continued destruction and renewal of the earth's surface would be
  in more powerful action, and must therefore tend to reduce the time
  required for the deposition and upheaval of the various geological
  formations. It may be true, as many geologists assert, that the changes
  here indicated are so slow that they would produce comparatively little
  effect within the time occupied by the known sedimentary rocks, yet,
  whatever effect they did produce would certainly be in the direction here
  indicated, and as several causes are acting together, their combined
  effects may have been by no means unimportant. It must also be remembered
  that such an increase of the primary forces on which all geologic change
  depends would act with great effect in still further intensifying those
  alternations of cold and warm periods in each hemisphere, or, more
  frequently, of excessive and equable seasons, which have been shown to be
  the result of astronomical, combined with geographical, revolutions; and
  this would again increase the rapidity of denudation and deposition, and
  thus still further reduce the time required for the production of the
  known sedimentary rocks. It is evident therefore that these various
  considerations all combine to prove that, in supposing that the rate of
  denudation has been on the average only what it is now, we are almost
  certainly over-estimating the <i>time</i> required to have produced the
  whole series of formations from the Cambrian upwards.</p>

  <p><i>Value of the Preceding Estimate of Geological Time.</i>&mdash;It is
  not of course supposed that the calculation here given <!-- Page 225
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225"></a>{225}</span>makes any
  approach to accuracy, but it is believed that it does indicate the
  <i>order</i> of magnitude of the time required. We have a certain number
  of data, which are not guessed but the result of actual measurement; such
  are, the amount of solid matter carried down by rivers, the width of the
  belt within which this matter is mainly deposited, and the maximum
  thickness of the known stratified rocks.<a name="NtA_97"
  href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> A considerable but unknown amount of
  denudation is effected by the waves of the ocean eating away coast lines.
  This was once thought to be of more importance than sub-aërial
  denudation, but it is now believed to be comparatively slow in its
  action.<a name="NtA_98" href="#Nt_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> Whatever it may
  be, however, it adds to the rate of formation of new strata, and its
  omission from the calculation is again on the side of making the lapse of
  time greater rather than less than the true amount. Even if a
  considerable modification should be needed in some of the assumptions it
  has been necessary to make, the result must still show that, so far as
  the time required for the formation of the known stratified rocks, the
  hundred million years allowed by physicists is not only ample, but will
  permit of even more than an equal period anterior to the lowest Cambrian
  rocks, as demanded by Mr. Darwin&mdash;a demand supported and enforced by
  the arguments, taken from independent standpoints, of Professor Huxley
  and Professor Ramsay.</p>

  <p><i>Organic Modification Dependent on Change of
  Conditions.</i>&mdash;Having <!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page226"></a>{226}</span>thus shown that the physical changes of
  the earth's surface may have gone on much more rapidly and occupied much
  less time than has generally been supposed, we have now to inquire
  whether there are any considerations which lead to the conclusion that
  organic changes may have gone on with corresponding rapidity.</p>

  <p>There is no part of the theory of natural selection which is more
  clear and satisfactory than that which connects changes of specific forms
  with changes of external conditions or environment. If the external world
  remains for a moderate period unchanged, the organic world soon reaches a
  state of equilibrium through the struggle for existence; each species
  occupies its place in nature, and there is then no inherent tendency to
  change. But almost any change whatever in the external world disturbs
  this equilibrium, and may set in motion a whole series of organic
  revolutions before it is restored. A change of climate in any direction
  will be sure to injure some and benefit other species. The one will
  consequently diminish, the other increase in number; and the former may
  even become extinct. But the extinction of a species will certainly
  affect other species which it either preyed upon, or competed with, or
  served for food; while the increase of any one animal may soon lead to
  the extinction of some other to which it was inimical. These changes will
  in their turn bring other changes; and before an equilibrium is again
  established, the proportions, ranges, and numbers, of the species
  inhabiting the country may be materially altered. The complex manner in
  which animals are related to each other is well exhibited by the
  importance of insects, which in many parts of the world limit the numbers
  or determine the very existence of some of the higher animals. Mr. Darwin
  says:&mdash;"Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious instance of this;
  for here neither cattle, nor horses, nor dogs have ever run wild, though
  they swarm southward and northward in a wild state; and Azara and Rengger
  have shown that this is caused by the greater number in Paraguay of a
  certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of these animals when
  first born. The increase of these flies, numerous as they are, must be
  <!-- Page 227 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page227"></a>{227}</span>habitually checked by some means, probably
  by other parasitic insects. Hence, if certain insectivorous birds were to
  decrease in Paraguay, the parasitic insects would probably increase; and
  this would lessen the number of navel-frequenting flies&mdash;then cattle
  and horses would run wild; and this would certainly alter (as indeed I
  have observed in parts of South America) the vegetation: this again would
  largely affect the insects, and this, as we have seen in Staffordshire,
  the insectivorous birds, and so onwards in ever increasing circles of
  complexity."</p>

  <p>Geographical changes would be still more important, and it is almost
  impossible to exaggerate the modifications of the organic world that
  might result from them. A subsidence of land separating a large island
  from a continent would affect the animals and plants in a variety of
  ways. It would at once modify the climate, and so produce a series of
  changes from this cause alone; but more important would be its effect by
  isolating small groups of individuals of many species and thus altering
  their relations to the rest of the organic world. Many of these would at
  once be exterminated, while others, being relieved from competition,
  might flourish and become modified into new species. Even more striking
  would be the effects when two continents, or any two land areas which had
  been long separated, were united by an upheaval of the strait which
  divided them. Numbers of animals would now be brought into competition
  for the first time. New enemies and new competitors would appear in every
  part of the country; and a struggle would commence which, after many
  fluctuations, would certainly result in the extinction of some species,
  the modification of others, and a considerable alteration in the
  proportionate numbers and the geographical distribution of almost
  all.</p>

  <p>Any other changes which led to the intermingling of species whose
  ranges were usually separate would produce corresponding results. Thus,
  increased severity of winter or summer temperature, causing southward
  migrations and the crowding together of the productions of distinct
  regions, must inevitably produce a struggle for existence, which would
  lead to many changes both in the characters and <!-- Page 228 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>{228}</span>the distribution of
  animals. Slow elevations of the land would produce another set of
  changes, by affording an extended area in which the more dominant species
  might increase their numbers; and by a greater range and variety of
  alpine climates and mountain stations, affording room for the development
  of new forms of life.</p>

  <p><i>Geographical Mutations as a Motive Power in Bringing about Organic
  Changes.</i>&mdash;Now, if we consider the various geographical changes
  which, as we have seen, there is good reason to believe have ever been
  going on in the world, we shall find that the motive power to initiate
  and urge on organic changes has never been wanting. In the first place,
  every continent, though permanent in a general sense, has been ever
  subject to innumerable physical and geographical modifications. At one
  time the total area has increased, and at another has diminished; great
  plateaus have gradually risen up, and have been eaten out by denudation
  into mountain and valley; volcanoes have burst forth, and, after
  accumulating vast masses of eruptive matter, have sunk down beneath the
  ocean, to be covered up with sedimentary rocks, and at a subsequent
  period again raised above the surface; and the <i>loci</i> of all these
  grand revolutions of the earth's surface have changed their position age
  after age, so that each portion of every continent has again and again
  been sunk under the ocean waves, formed the bed of some inland sea, or
  risen high into plateaus and mountain ranges. How great must have been
  the effects of such changes on every form of organic life! And it is to
  such as these we may perhaps trace those great changes of the animal
  world which have seemed to revolutionise it, and have led us to class one
  geological period as the age of reptiles, another as the age of fishes,
  and a third as the age of mammals.</p>

  <p>But such changes as these must necessarily have led to repeated unions
  and separations of the land masses of the globe, joining together
  continents which were before divided, and breaking up others into great
  islands or extensive archipelagoes. Such alterations of the means of
  transit would probably affect the organic world even more profoundly than
  the changes of area, of altitude, or <!-- Page 229 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page229"></a>{229}</span>of climate, since they
  afforded the means, at long intervals, of bringing the most diverse forms
  into competition, and of spreading all the great animal and vegetable
  types widely over the globe. But the isolation of considerable masses of
  land for long periods also afforded the means of preservation to many of
  the lower types, which thus had time to become modified into a variety of
  distinct forms, some of which became so well adapted to special modes of
  life that they have continued to exist to the present day, thus affording
  us examples of the life of early ages which would probably long since
  have become extinct had they been always subject to the competition of
  the more highly organised animals. As examples of such excessively
  archaic forms, we may mention the mud-fishes and the ganoids, confined to
  limited fresh-water areas; the frogs and toads, which still maintain
  themselves vigorously in competition with higher forms; and among mammals
  the Ornithorhynchus and Echidna of Australia; the whole order of
  Marsupials&mdash;which, out of Australia, where they are quite free from
  competition, only exist abundantly in South America, which was certainly
  long isolated from the northern continents; the Insectivora, which,
  though widely scattered, are generally nocturnal or subterranean in their
  habits; and the Lemurs, which are most abundant in Madagascar, where they
  have long been isolated, and almost removed from the competition of
  higher forms.</p>

  <p><i>Climatal Revolutions as an Agent in Producing Organic
  Changes.</i>&mdash;The geographical and geological changes we have been
  considering are probably those which have been most effective in bringing
  about the great features of the distribution of animals, as well as the
  larger movements in the development of organised beings; but it is to the
  alternations of warm and cold, or of uniform and excessive
  climates&mdash;of almost perpetual spring in arctic as well as in
  temperate lands, with occasional phases of cold culminating at remote
  intervals in glacial epochs,&mdash;that we must impute some of the more
  remarkable changes both in the specific characters and in the
  distribution of organisms.<a name="NtA_99"
  href="#Nt_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a> <!-- Page 230 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>{230}</span>Although the geological
  evidence is opposed to the belief in early glacial epochs except at very
  remote and distant intervals, there is nothing which contradicts the
  occurrence of repeated changes of climate, which, though too small in
  amount to produce any well-marked physical or organic change, would yet
  be amply sufficient to keep the organic world in a constant state of
  movement, and which, by subjecting the whole flora and fauna of a country
  at comparatively short intervals to decided changes of physical
  conditions, would supply that stimulus and motive power which, as we have
  seen, is all that is necessary to keep the processes of "natural
  selection" in constant operation.</p>

  <p>The frequent recurrence of periods of high and of low excentricity
  must certainly have produced changes of climate of considerable
  importance to the life of animals and plants. During periods of high
  excentricity with summer in <i>perihelion</i>, that season would be
  certainly very much hotter, while the winters would be longer and colder
  than at present; and although geographical conditions might prevent any
  permanent increase of snow and ice even in the extreme north, yet we
  cannot doubt that the whole northern hemisphere would then have a very
  different climate than when the changing phase of precession brought a
  very cool summer and a very mild winter&mdash;a perpetual spring, in
  fact. Now, such a change of climate would certainly be calculated to
  bring about a considerable change of <i>species</i>, both by modification
  and migration, without any such decided change of <i>type</i> either in
  the vegetation or the animals that we could say from their fossil remains
  that any change of climate had taken place. Let us suppose, for instance,
  that the climate of England and that of Canada were to be mutually
  exchanged, and that the change took five or six thousand years to bring
  about, it cannot be doubted that considerable modifications in the fauna
  and flora of both countries would be the result, although it is
  impossible to predict <!-- Page 231 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page231"></a>{231}</span>what the precise changes would be. We can
  safely say, however, that some species would stand the change better than
  others, while it is highly probable that some would be actually benefited
  by it, and that others would be injured. But the benefited would
  certainly increase, and the injured decrease, in consequence, and thus a
  series of changes would be initiated that might lead to most important
  results. Again, we are sure that some species would become modified in
  adaptation to the change of climate more readily than others, and these
  modified species would therefore increase at the expense of others not so
  readily modified; and hence would arise on the one hand extinction of
  species, and on the other the production of new forms.</p>

  <p>But this is the very least amount of change of climate that would
  certainly occur every 10,500 years when there was a high excentricity,
  for it is impossible to doubt that a varying distance of the sun in
  summer from 86 to 99 millions of miles (which is what occurred
  during&mdash;as supposed&mdash;the Miocene period, 850,000 years ago)
  would produce an important difference in the summer temperature and in
  the actinic influence of sunshine on vegetation. For the intensity of the
  sun's rays would vary as the square of the distance, or nearly as 74 to
  98, so that the earth would be actually receiving one-fourth less
  sun-heat during summer at one time than at the other. An equally high
  excentricity occurred 2,500,000 years back, and no doubt was often
  reached during still earlier epochs, while a lower but still very high
  excentricity has frequently prevailed, and is probably near its average
  value. Changes of climate, therefore, every 10,500 years, of the
  character above indicated and of varying intensity, have been the rule
  rather than the exception in past time; and these changes must have been
  variously modified by changing geographical conditions so as to produce
  climatic alterations in different directions, giving to the ancient lands
  either dry or wet seasons, storms or calms, equable or excessive
  temperatures, in a variety of combinations of which the earth perhaps
  affords no example under the present low phase of <!-- Page 232 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page232"></a>{232}</span>excentricity and
  consequent slight inequality of sun-heat.</p>

  <p><i>Present Condition of the Earth One of Exceptional Stability as
  Regards Climate.</i>&mdash;It will be seen, by a reference to the diagram
  at page <a href="#page171">171</a>, that during the last three million
  years the excentricity has been <i>less</i> than it is now on eight
  occasions, for short periods only, making up a total of about 280,000
  years; while it has been <i>more</i> than it is now for many long
  periods, of from 300,000 to 700,000 years each, making a total of
  2,720,000 years; or nearly as 10 to 1. For nearly half the entire period,
  or 1,400,000 years, the excentricity has been nearly double what it is
  now, and this is not far from its mean condition. We have no reason for
  supposing that this long period of three million years, for which we have
  tables, was in any way exceptional as regards the degree or variation of
  excentricity; but, on the contrary, we may pretty safely assume that its
  variations during this time fairly represent its average state of
  increase and decrease during all known geological time. But when the
  glacial epoch ended, 72,000 years ago, the excentricity was about double
  its present amount; it then rapidly decreased till, at 60,000 years back,
  it was very little greater than it is now, and since then it has been
  uniformly small. It follows that, for about 60,000 years before our time,
  the mutations of climate every 10,500 years have been comparatively
  unimportant, and that the temperate zones have enjoyed <i>an exceptional
  stability of climate</i>. During this time those powerful causes of
  organic change which depend on considerable changes of climate and the
  consequent modifications, migrations, and extinctions of species, will
  not have been at work; the slight changes that did occur would probably
  be so slow and so little marked that the various species would be able to
  adapt themselves to them without much disturbance; and the result would
  be <i>an epoch of exceptional stability of species</i>.</p>

  <p>But it is from this very period of <i>exceptional stability</i> that
  we obtain our only <i>scale</i> for measuring the rate of organic change.
  It includes not only the historical period, <!-- Page 233 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page233"></a>{233}</span>but that of the Swiss
  Lake dwellings, the Danish shell-mounds, our peat-bogs, our sunken
  forests, and many of our superficial alluvial deposits&mdash;the whole in
  fact, of the iron, bronze, and neolithic ages. Even some portion of the
  palæolithic age, and of the more recent gravels and cave-earths may come
  into the same general period if they were formed when the glacial epoch
  was passing away. Now throughout all these ages we find no indication of
  change of species, and but little, comparatively, of migration. We thus
  get an erroneous idea of <i>the permanence and stability of specific
  forms</i>, due to the period immediately antecedent to our own being a
  <i>period of exceptional permanence and stability</i> as regards climatic
  and geographical conditions.<a name="NtA_100"
  href="#Nt_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Date of Last Glacial Epoch and its Bearing on the Measurement of
  Geological Time.</i>&mdash;Directly we go back from this stable period we
  come upon changes both in the forms and in the distribution of species;
  and when we pass beyond the last glacial epoch into the Pliocene period
  we find ourselves in a comparatively new world, surrounded by a
  considerable number of species altogether different from any which now
  exist, together with many others which, though still living, now inhabit
  distant regions. It seems not improbable that what is termed the Pliocene
  period, was really the coming on of the glacial epoch, and this is the
  opinion of Professor Jules Marcou.<a name="NtA_101"
  href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> According to our views, a
  considerable amount of geographical change must have occurred at the
  change from the Miocene to the Pliocene, favouring the refrigeration of
  the northern hemisphere, and leading, in the way already pointed out, to
  the glacial epoch whenever a high degree of excentricity <!-- Page 234
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>{234}</span>prevailed. As
  many reasons combine to make us fix the height of the glacial epoch at
  the period of high excentricity which occurred 200,000 years back, and as
  the Pliocene period was probably not of long duration, we must suppose
  the next great phase of very high excentricity (850,000 years ago) to
  fall within the Miocene epoch. Dr. Croll believes that this must have
  produced a glacial period, but we have shown strong reasons for believing
  that, in concurrence with favourable geographical conditions, it led to
  uninterrupted warm climates in the temperate and northern zones. This,
  however, did not prevent the occurrence of local glaciation wherever
  other conditions led to its initiation, and the most powerful of such
  conditions is a great extent of high land. Now we know that the Alps
  acquired a considerable part of their elevation during the latter part of
  the Miocene period, since Miocene rocks occur at an elevation of over
  6,000 feet, while Eocene beds occur at nearly 10,000 feet. But since that
  time there has been a vast amount of denudation, so that these rocks may
  have been at first raised much higher than we now find them, and thus a
  considerable portion of the Alps may have been more elevated than they
  are now. This would certainly lead to an enormous accumulation of snow,
  which would be increased when the excentricity reached a maximum, as
  already fully explained, and may then have caused glaciers to descend
  into the adjacent sea, carrying those enormous masses of rock which are
  buried in the Upper Miocene of the Superga in Northern Italy. An earlier
  epoch of great altitude in the Alps coinciding with the very high
  excentricity 2,500,000 years ago, may have caused the local glaciation of
  the Middle Eocene period when the enormous erratics of the Flysch
  conglomerate were deposited in the inland seas of Northern Switzerland,
  the Carpathians, and the Apennines. This is quite in harmony with the
  <span class="correction" title="Original reads `indic-tions' on line break."
  >indications</span> of an uninterrupted warm climate and rich vegetation
  during the very same period in the adjacent low countries, just as we
  find at the present day in New Zealand a delightful climate and a rich
  vegetation of Metrosideros, <!-- Page 235 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page235"></a>{235}</span>fuchsias and tree-ferns on the very
  borders of huge glaciers, descending to within 700 feet of the sea-level.
  It is not pretended that these estimates of geological time have any more
  value than probable guesses; but it is certainly a curious coincidence
  that two remarkable periods of high excentricity should have occurred, at
  such periods and at such intervals apart, as very well accord with the
  comparative remoteness of the two deposits in which undoubted signs of
  ice-action have been found, and that both these are localised in the
  vicinity of mountains which are known to have acquired a considerable
  elevation at about the same period of time.</p>

  <p>In the tenth edition of the <i>Principles of Geology</i>, Sir Charles
  Lyell, taking the amount of change in the species of mollusca as a guide,
  estimated the time elapsed since the commencement of the Miocene as
  one-third that of the whole Tertiary epoch, and the latter at one-fourth
  that of geological time since the Cambrian period. Professor Dana, on the
  other hand, estimates the Tertiary as only one-fifteenth of the Mesozoic
  and Palæozoic combined. On the estimate above given, founded on the dates
  of phases of high excentricity, we shall arrive at about four million
  years for the Tertiary epoch, and sixteen million years for the time
  elapsed since the Cambrian, according to Lyell, or sixty millions
  according to Dana. The estimate arrived at from the rate of denudation
  and deposition (twenty-eight million years) is nearly midway between
  these, and it is, at all events, satisfactory that the various measures
  result in figures of the same order of magnitude, which is all one can
  expect when discussing so difficult and exceedingly speculative a
  subject.</p>

  <p>The only value of such estimates is to define our notions of
  geological time, and to show that the enormous periods, of hundreds of
  millions of years, which have sometimes been indicated by geologists, are
  neither necessary nor warranted by the facts at our command; while the
  present result places us more in harmony with the calculations of
  physicists, by leaving a very wide margin between geological time as
  defined by the fossiliferous rocks, and that <!-- Page 236 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page236"></a>{236}</span>far more extensive
  period which includes all possibility of life upon the earth.</p>

  <p><i>Concluding Remarks.</i>&mdash;In the present chapter I have
  endeavoured to show that, combining the measured rate of denudation with
  the estimated thickness and probable extent of the known series of
  sedimentary rocks, we may arrive at a rude estimate of the time occupied
  in the formation of those rocks. From another point of
  departure&mdash;that of the probable date of the Miocene period, as
  determined by the epoch of high excentricity supposed to have aided in
  the production of the Alpine glaciation during that period, and taking
  the estimate of geologists as to the proportionate amount of change in
  the animal world since that epoch&mdash;we obtain another estimate of the
  duration of geological time, which, though founded on far less secure
  data, agrees pretty nearly with the former estimate. The time thus
  arrived at is immensely less than the usual estimates of geologists, and
  is so far within the limits of the duration of the earth as calculated by
  Sir William Thomson, as to allow for the development of the lower
  organisms an amount of time anterior to the Cambrian period several times
  greater than has elapsed between that period and the present day. I have
  further shown that, in the continued mutations of climate produced by
  high excentricity and opposite phases of precession, even though these
  did not lead to glacial epochs, we have a motive power well calculated to
  produce far more rapid organic changes than have hitherto been thought
  possible; while in the enormous amount of specific variation (as
  demonstrated in an earlier chapter), we have ample material for that
  power to act upon, so as to keep the organic world in a state of rapid
  change and development proportioned to the comparatively rapid changes in
  the earth's surface.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We have now finished the series of preliminary studies of the
  biological conditions and physical changes which have affected the
  modification and dispersal of organisms, and have thus brought about
  their actual distribution on <!-- Page 237 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page237"></a>{237}</span>the surface of the earth. These studies
  will, it is believed, place us in a condition to solve most of the
  problems presented by the distribution of animals and plants, whenever
  the necessary facts, both as to their distribution and their affinities,
  are sufficiently well known; and we now proceed to apply the principles
  we have established to the interpretation of the phenomena presented by
  some of the more important and best known of the islands of our globe,
  limiting ourselves to these for reasons which have been already
  sufficiently explained in our preface.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE CLASSIFICATION OF ISLANDS</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Importance of Islands in the Study of the Distribution of
  Organisms&mdash;Classification of Islands with Reference to
  Distribution&mdash;Continental Islands&mdash;Oceanic Islands.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the preceding chapters, forming the first part of our work, we have
  discussed, more or less fully, the general features presented by animal
  distribution, as well as the various physical and biological changes
  which have been the most important agents in bringing about the present
  condition of the organic world.</p>

  <p>We now proceed to apply these principles to the solution of the
  numerous problems presented by the distribution of animals; and in order
  to limit the field of our inquiry, and at the same time to deal only with
  such facts as may be rendered intelligible and interesting to those
  readers who have not much acquaintance with the details of natural
  history, we propose to consider only such phenomena as are presented by
  the islands of the globe.</p>

  <p><i>Importance of Islands in the Study of the Distribution of
  Organisms.</i>&mdash;Islands possess many advantages for the study of the
  laws and phenomena of distribution. As compared with continents they have
  a restricted area and definite boundaries, and in most cases their
  geographical and biological limits coincide. The number of species and of
  genera they contain is always much smaller than in the <!-- Page 242
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242"></a>{242}</span>case of
  continents, and their peculiar species and groups are usually well
  defined and strictly limited in range. Again, their relations with other
  lands are often direct and simple, and even when more complex are far
  easier to comprehend than those of continents; and they exhibit besides
  certain influences on the forms of life and certain peculiarities in
  their distribution which continents do not present, and whose study
  offers many points of interest.</p>

  <p>In islands we have the facts of distribution presented to us,
  sometimes in their simplest forms, in other cases becoming gradually more
  and more complex; and we are therefore able to proceed step by step in
  the solution of the problems they present. But as in studying these
  problems we have necessarily to take into account the relations of the
  insular and continental faunas, we also get some knowledge of the latter,
  and acquire besides so much command over the general principles which
  underlie all problems of distribution, that it is not too much to say
  that when we have mastered the difficulties presented by the
  peculiarities of island life we shall find it comparatively easy to deal
  with the more complex and less clearly defined problems of continental
  distribution.</p>

  <p><i>Classification of Islands with Reference to
  Distribution.</i>&mdash;Islands have had two distinct modes of
  origin&mdash;they have either been separated from continents of which
  they are but detached fragments, or they have originated in the ocean and
  have never formed part of a continent or any large mass of land. This
  difference of origin is fundamental, and leads to a most important
  difference in their animal inhabitants; and we may therefore first
  distinguish the two classes&mdash;oceanic and continental islands.</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin appears to have been the first writer who called attention
  to the number and importance, both from a geological and biological point
  of view, of oceanic islands. He showed that with very few exceptions all
  the remoter islands of the great oceans were of volcanic or coralline
  formation, and that none of them contained indigenous mammalia or
  amphibia. He also showed the connection of these two phenomena, and
  maintained that none of the islands so characterised had ever formed <!--
  Page 243 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>{243}</span>part
  of a continent. This was quite opposed to the opinions of the scientific
  men of the day, who almost all held the idea of continental extensions,
  and of oceanic islands being their fragments, and it was long before Mr.
  Darwin's views obtained general acceptance. Even now the belief still
  lingers; and we continually hear of old Atlantic or Pacific continents,
  of "Atlantis" or "Lemuria," of which hypothetical lands many existing
  islands, although wholly volcanic, are thought to be the remnants. We
  have already seen that Darwin connected the peculiar geological structure
  of oceanic islands with the permanence of the great oceans which contain
  them, and we have shown that several distinct lines of evidence all point
  to the same conclusion. We may therefore define oceanic islands, as
  follows:&mdash;Islands of volcanic or coralline formation, usually far
  from continents and always separated from them by very deep sea, entirely
  without indigenous land mammalia or amphibia, but with a fair number of
  birds and insects, and usually with some reptiles. This definition will
  exclude only two islands which have been sometimes classed as
  oceanic&mdash;New Zealand and the Seychelles. Rodriguez, which was once
  thought to be another exception, has been shown by the explorations
  during the Transit of Venus Expedition to be essentially volcanic, with
  some upraised coralline limestone.</p>

  <p><i>Continental Islands.</i>&mdash;Continental islands are always more
  varied in their geological formation, containing both ancient and recent
  stratified rocks. They are rarely very remote from a continent, and they
  always contain some land mammals and amphibia, as well as representatives
  of the other classes and orders in considerable variety. They may,
  however, be divided into two well-marked groups&mdash;ancient and recent
  continental islands&mdash;the characters of which may be easily
  defined.</p>

  <p>Recent continental islands are always situated on submerged banks
  connecting them with a continent, and the depth of the intervening sea
  rarely exceeds 100 fathoms. They resemble the continent in their
  geological structure, while their animal and vegetable productions are
  either almost identical with those of the continent, or if <!-- Page 244
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244"></a>{244}</span>otherwise, the
  difference consists in the presence of closely allied species of the same
  types, with occasionally a very few peculiar genera. They possess in fact
  all the characteristics of a portion of the continent, separated from it
  at a recent geological period.</p>

  <p>Ancient continental islands differ greatly from the preceding in many
  respects. They are not united to the adjacent continent by a shallow
  bank, but are usually separated from it by a depth of sea of several
  hundreds to more than a thousand fathoms. In geological structure they
  agree generally with the more recent islands; like them they possess
  mammalia and amphibia, usually in considerable abundance, as well as all
  other classes of animals; but these are highly peculiar, almost all being
  distinct species, and many forming distinct and peculiar genera or
  families. They are also well characterised by the fragmentary nature of
  their fauna, many of the most characteristic continental orders or
  families being quite unrepresented, while some of their animals are
  allied, not to such forms as inhabit the adjacent continent, but to
  others found only in remote parts of the world. This very remarkable set
  of characters marks off the islands which exhibit them as a distinct
  class, which often present the greatest anomalies and most difficult
  problems to the student of distribution.</p>

  <p><i>Oceanic Islands.</i>&mdash;The total absence of warm-blooded
  terrestrial animals in an island otherwise well suited to maintain them,
  is held to prove that such island is no mere fragment of any existing or
  submerged continent, but one that has been actually produced in
  mid-ocean. It is true that if a continental island were to be completely
  submerged for a single day and then again elevated, its higher
  terrestrial animals would be all destroyed, and if it were situated at a
  considerable distance from land it would be reduced to the same
  zoological condition as an oceanic island. But such a complete
  submergence and re-elevation appears never to have taken place, for there
  is no single island on the globe which has the physical and geological
  features of a continental, combined with the zoological features of an
  oceanic island. It is true that some of the coral-islands may be formed
  upon submerged lands <!-- Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page245"></a>{245}</span>of a continental character, but we have no
  proof of this; and even if it were so, the existing islands are to all
  intents and purposes oceanic.</p>

  <p>We will now pass on to a consideration of some of the more interesting
  examples of these three classes, beginning with oceanic islands.</p>

  <p>All the animals which now inhabit such oceanic islands must either
  themselves have reached them by crossing the ocean, or be the descendants
  of ancestors who did so. Let us then see what are, in fact, the animal
  and vegetable inhabitants of these islands, and how far their presence
  can be accounted for. We will begin with the Azores, or Western Islands,
  because they have been thoroughly well explored by naturalists, and in
  their peculiarities afford us an important clue to some of the most
  efficient means of distribution among several classes of animals.</p>

  <p>We will commence our investigation into the phenomena presented by
  oceanic islands, with two groups of the North Atlantic, in which the
  facts are of a comparatively simple nature and such as to afford us a
  valuable clue to a solution of the more difficult problems we shall have
  to deal with further on. The Azores and Bermuda offer great contrasts in
  physical features, but striking similarities in geographical position.
  The one is volcanic, the other coralline; but both are surrounded by a
  wide expanse of ocean of enormous depth, the one being about as far from
  Europe as the other is from America. Both are situated in the <!-- Page
  247 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>{247}</span>temperate
  zone, and they differ less than six degrees in latitude, yet the
  vegetation of the one is wholly temperate, while that of the other is
  almost tropical. The productions of the one are related to Europe, as
  those of the other are to America, but they present instructive
  differences; and both afford evidence of the highest value as to the
  means of dispersal of various groups of organisms across a wide expanse
  of ocean.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE AZORES, OR WESTERN ISLANDS.</p>

  <p>These islands, nine in number, form a widely scattered group, situated
  between 37° and 39° 40&prime; N. Lat. and stretching in a south-east and
  north-west direction over a distance of nearly 400 miles. The largest of
  the islands, San Miguel, is about forty miles long, and is one of the
  nearest to Europe, being rather under 900 miles from the coast of
  Portugal, from which it is separated by an ocean 2,500 fathoms deep. The
  depth between the islands does not seem to be known, but the 1,000 fathom
  line encloses the whole group pretty closely, while a depth of about
  1,800 fathoms is reached within 300 miles in all directions. These great
  depths render it in the highest degree improbable that the Azores have
  ever been united with the European continent; while their being wholly
  volcanic is equally opposed to the view of their having formed part of an
  extensive Atlantis including Madeira and the Canaries. The only exception
  to their volcanic structure is the occurrence in one small island only
  (Santa Maria) of some marine deposits of Upper Miocene age&mdash;a fact
  which proves some alterations of level, and perhaps a greater extension
  of this island at some former period, but in no way indicates a former
  union of the islands, or any greater extension of the whole group. It
  proves, however, that the group is of considerable antiquity, since it
  must date back to Miocene times; and this fact may be of importance in
  considering the origin and peculiar features of the fauna and flora. It
  thus appears that in all physical features the Azores correspond strictly
  with our physical definition of "oceanic islands," while their great
  distance <!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page248"></a>{248}</span>from any other land, and the depth of the
  ocean around them, make them typical examples of the class. We should
  therefore expect them to be equally typical in their fauna and flora; and
  this is the case as regards the most important characteristics, although
  in some points of detail they present exceptional phenomena.</p>

  <p><i>Chief Zoological Features of the Azores.</i><a name="NtA_102"
  href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a>&mdash;The great feature of oceanic
  islands&mdash;the absence of all indigenous land-mammalia and
  amphibia&mdash;is well shown in this <!-- Page 249 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page249"></a>{249}</span>group; and it is even
  carried further, so as to include all terrestrial vertebrata, there being
  no snake, lizard, frog, or fresh-water fish, although the islands are
  sufficiently extensive, possess a mild and equable climate, and are in
  every way adapted to support all these groups. On the other hand, flying
  creatures, as birds and insects, are abundant; and there is also one
  flying mammal&mdash;a small European bat. It is true that rabbits,
  weasels, rats and mice, and a small lizard peculiar to Madeira and
  Teneriffe, are now found wild in the Azores, but there is good reason to
  believe that these have all been introduced by human agency. The same may
  be said of the gold-fish and eels now found in some of the lakes, there
  being not a single fresh-water fish which is truly indigenous to the
  islands. When we consider that the nearest part of the group is about 900
  miles from Portugal, and more than 550 miles from Madeira, it is not
  surprising that none of these terrestrial animals can have passed over
  such a wide expanse of ocean unassisted by man.</p>

  <p>Let us now see what animals are believed to have reached the group by
  natural means, and thus constitute its indigenous fauna. These consist of
  birds, insects, and land-shells, each of which must be considered
  separately.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;Fifty-three species of birds have been observed at
  the Azores, but the larger proportion (thirty-one) are either aquatic or
  waders&mdash;birds of great powers of flight, whose presence in the
  remotest islands is by no means remarkable. Of these two groups twenty
  are residents, breeding in the islands, while eleven are stragglers only
  visiting the islands occasionally, and all are common European species.
  The land-birds, twenty-two in number, are more interesting, four only
  being stragglers, while eighteen are permanent residents. The following
  is a list of these resident land-birds:&mdash;</p>

  <p>All the above-named birds are common in Europe and North Africa except
  three&mdash;the Atlantic chaffinch and the canary which inhabit Madeira
  and the Canary Islands, and the Azorean bullfinch, which is peculiar to
  the islands we are considering.</p>

  <p><i>Origin of the Azorean Bird-fauna.</i>&mdash;The questions we have
  now before us are&mdash;how did these eighteen species of birds first
  reach the Azores, and how are we to explain the presence of a single
  peculiar species while all the rest are identical with European birds? In
  order to answer them, let us first see what stragglers now actually visit
  the Azores from the nearest continents. The four species given in Mr.
  Godman's list are the kestrel, the oriole, the snow-bunting, and the
  hoopoe; but he also tells us that there are certainly others, and adds:
  "Scarcely a storm occurs in spring or autumn without bringing one or more
  species foreign to the islands; and I have frequently been told that
  swallows, larks, grebes, and other species not referred to here, are not
  uncommonly seen at those seasons of the year."</p>

  <p>We have, therefore, every reason to believe that the birds which are
  now residents originated as stragglers, which occasionally found a haven
  in these remote islands when driven out to sea by storms. Some of them,
  no doubt, still often arrive from the continent, but these cannot easily
  be distinguished as new arrivals among those which are permanent
  inhabitants. Many facts mentioned by Mr. Godman show that this is the
  case. A barn-owl, much exhausted, flew on board a whaling-ship when 500
  miles S.W. of the Azores; and even if it had come from <!-- Page 251
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>{251}</span>Madeira it
  must have travelled quite as far as from Portugal to the islands. Mr.
  Godman also shot a single specimen of the wheatear in Flores after a
  strong gale of wind, and as no one on the island knew the bird, it was
  almost certainly a recent arrival. Subsequently a few were found breeding
  in the old crater of Corvo, a small adjacent island; and as the species
  is not found in any other island of the group, we may infer that this
  bird is a recent immigrant in process of establishing itself.</p>

  <p>Another fact which is almost conclusive in favour of the
  bird-population having arrived as stragglers is, that they are most
  abundant in the islands nearest to Europe and Africa. The Azores consist
  of three divisions&mdash;an eastern, consisting of two islands, St.
  Michael's and St. Mary's; a central of five, Terceira, Graciosa, St.
  George's, Pico, and Fayal; and a western of two, Flores and Corvo. Now
  had the whole group once been united to the continent, or even formed
  parts of one extensive Atlantic island, we should certainly expect the
  central group, which is more compact and has a much larger area than all
  the rest, to have the greatest number and variety of birds. But the fact
  that birds are most numerous in the eastern group, and diminish as we go
  westward, is entirely opposed to this theory, while it is strictly in
  accordance with the view that they are all stragglers from Europe,
  Africa, or the other Atlantic islands. Omitting oceanic wanderers, and
  including all birds which have probably arrived involuntarily, the
  numbers are found to be forty species in the eastern group, thirty-six in
  the central, and twenty-nine in the western.</p>

  <p>To account for the presence of one peculiar species&mdash;the
  bullfinch (which, however, does not differ from the common European
  bullfinch more than do some of the varieties of North American birds from
  their type-species) is not difficult; the wonder rather being that there
  are not more peculiar forms. In our third chapter we have seen how great
  is the amount of individual variation in birds, and how readily local
  varieties become established wherever the physical conditions are
  sufficiently distinct. Now we can hardly have a greater difference of
  conditions <!-- Page 252 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page252"></a>{252}</span>than between the continent of Europe or
  North Africa, and a group of rocky islands in mid-Atlantic, situated in
  the full course of the Gulf Stream and with an excessively mild though
  stormy climate. We have every reason to believe that special
  modifications would soon become established in any animals completely
  isolated under such conditions. But they are not, as a rule, thus
  completely isolated, because, as we have seen, stragglers arrive at short
  intervals; and these, mixing with the residents, keep up the purity of
  the breed. It follows, that only those species which reach the Azores at
  very remote intervals will be likely to acquire well-marked distinctive
  characters; and this appears to have happened with the bullfinch alone, a
  bird which does not migrate, and is therefore less likely to be blown out
  to sea, more especially as it inhabits woody districts. A few other
  Azorean birds, however, exhibit slight differences from their European
  allies.</p>

  <p>There is another reason for the very slight amount of peculiarity
  presented by the fauna of the Azores as compared with many other oceanic
  islands, dependent on its comparatively recent origin. The islands
  themselves may be of considerable antiquity, since a few small deposits,
  believed to be of Miocene age, have been found on them, but there can be
  little doubt that their present fauna, at all events as concerns the
  birds, had its origin since the date of the last glacial epoch. Even now
  icebergs reach the latitude of the Azores but a little to the west of
  them; and when we consider the proofs of extensive ice-action in North
  America and Europe, we can hardly doubt that these islands were at that
  time surrounded with pack-ice, while their own mountains, reaching 7,600
  feet high in Pico, would almost certainly have been covered with
  perpetual snow and have sent down glaciers to the sea. They might then
  have had a climate almost as bad as that now endured by the Prince Edward
  Islands in the southern hemisphere, nearly ten degrees farther from the
  equator, where there are no land-birds whatever, although the distance
  from Africa is not much greater than that of the Azores from Europe,
  while the vegetation is limited to a few alpine plants and mosses. This
  recent origin of the <!-- Page 253 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page253"></a>{253}</span>birds accounts in a great measure for
  their identity with those of Europe, because, whatever change has
  occurred must have been effected in the islands themselves, and in a time
  limited to that which has elapsed since the glacial epoch passed
  away.</p>

  <p><i>Insects of the Azores.</i>&mdash;Having thus found no difficulty in
  accounting for the peculiarities presented by the birds of these islands,
  we have only to see how far the same general principles will apply to the
  insects and land-shells. The butterflies, moths, and hymenoptera, are few
  in number, and almost all seem to be common European species, whose
  presence is explained by the same causes as those which have introduced
  the birds. Beetles, however, are more numerous, and have been better
  studied, and these present some features of interest. The total number of
  species yet known is 212, of which 175 are European; but out of these 101
  are believed to have been introduced by human agency, leaving
  seventy-four really indigenous. Twenty-three of these indigenous species
  are not found in any of the other Atlantic islands, showing that they
  have been introduced directly from Europe by causes which have acted more
  powerfully here than farther south. Besides these there are thirty-six
  species not found in Europe, of which nineteen are natives of Madeira or
  the Canaries, three are American, and fourteen are altogether peculiar to
  the Azores. These latter are mostly allied to species found in Europe or
  in the other Atlantic islands, while one is allied to an American
  species, and two are so distinct as to constitute new genera. The
  following list of these peculiar species will be interesting:&mdash;</p>

  <p>This greater amount of speciality in the beetles than in the birds may
  be due to two causes. In the first place many of these small insects have
  no doubt survived the glacial epoch, and may, in that case, represent
  very ancient forms which have become extinct in their native country; and
  in the second place, insects have many more chances of reaching remote
  islands than birds, for not only may they be carried by gales of wind,
  but sometimes, in the egg or larva state or even as perfect insects, they
  may be drifted safely for weeks over the ocean, buried in the light stems
  of plants or in the solid wood of trees in which many of them undergo
  their transformations. Thus we may explain the presence of three common
  South American species (two elaters and a longicorn), all wood-eaters,
  and therefore liable to be occasionally brought in floating timber by the
  Gulf Stream. But insects are also immensely more numerous in species than
  are land-birds, and their transmission would be in most cases quite
  involuntary, and not dependent on their own powers of flight as with
  birds; and thus the chances against the same species being frequently
  carried to the same island would be considerable. If we add to this the
  dependence of so <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page255"></a>{255}</span>many insects on local conditions of
  climate and vegetation, and their liability to be destroyed by
  insectivorous birds, we shall see that, although there may be a greater
  probability of insects as a whole reaching the islands, the chance
  against any particular species arriving there, or against the same
  species arriving frequently, is much greater than in the case of birds.
  The result is, that (as compared with Britain for example) the birds are,
  proportionately, much more numerous than the beetles, while the peculiar
  species of beetles are much more numerous than among birds, both facts
  being quite in accordance with what we know of the habits of the two
  groups. We may also remark, that the small size and obscure characters of
  many of the beetles renders it probable that species now supposed to be
  peculiar, really inhabit some parts of Europe or North Africa.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that the two families which are
  pre-eminently wood, root, or seed eaters, are those which present the
  greatest amount of speciality. The two Elateridæ alone exhibit remote
  affinities, the one with a Brazilian the other with a Madagascar group;
  while the only peculiar genera belong to the Rhyncophora, but are allied
  to European forms. These last almost certainly form a portion of the more
  ancient fauna of the islands which migrated to them in pre-glacial times,
  while the Brazilian elater appears to be the solitary example of a living
  insect brought by the Gulf Stream to these remote shores. The elater,
  having its nearest living ally in Madagascar (<i>Elastrus dolosus</i>),
  cannot be held to indicate any independent communication between these
  distant islands; but is more probably a relic of a once more widespread
  type which has only been able to maintain itself in these localities. Mr.
  Crotch states that there are some <i>species</i> of beetles common to
  Madagascar and the Canary Islands, while there are several <i>genera</i>,
  common to Madagascar and South America, and some to Madagascar and
  Australia. The clue to these apparent anomalies is found in other genera
  being common to Madagascar, Africa, and South America, while others are
  Asiatic or Australian. Madagascar, in fact, has insect relations with
  every part of <!-- Page 256 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page256"></a>{256}</span>the globe, and the only rational
  explanation of such facts is, that they are indications of very ancient
  and once widespread groups, maintaining themselves only in a few widely
  separated portions of what was at one time or another the area of their
  distribution.</p>

  <p><i>Land-shells of the Azores.</i>&mdash;Like the insects and birds,
  the land-shells of these islands have a generally European aspect, but
  with a larger proportion of peculiar species. This was to be expected,
  because the means by which molluscs are carried over the sea are far less
  numerous and varied than in the case of insects;<a name="NtA_103"
  href="#Nt_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> and we may therefore conclude that
  their introduction is a very rare event, and that a species once arrived
  remains for long periods undisturbed by new arrivals, and is therefore
  more likely to become modified by the new conditions, and then fixed as a
  distinct type. Out of the sixty-nine known species, thirty-seven are
  common to Europe or the other Atlantic islands, while thirty-two are
  peculiar, though almost all are distinctly allied to European types. The
  majority of these shells, especially the peculiar forms, are very small,
  and many of them may date back to beyond the glacial epoch. The eggs of
  these would be exceedingly minute, and might occasionally be carried on
  leaves or other materials during gales of exceptional violence and
  duration, while others might be conveyed with the earth that often sticks
  to the feet of birds. There are also, probably, other unknown means of
  conveyance; but however this may be, the general character of the
  land-molluscs is such as to confirm the conclusions we have arrived at
  from a study of the birds and insects,&mdash;that these islands have
  never been connected with a continent, and have been peopled with living
  things by such forms only as in some way or other have been able to reach
  them across many hundred miles of ocean.</p>

  <p><i>The Flora of the Azores.</i>&mdash;The flowering-plants of the
  Azores have been studied by one of our first botanists, Mr. H.&nbsp;C. Watson,
  who has himself visited the islands and made extensive collections; and
  he has given a complete catalogue of the species in Mr. Godman's volume.
  As our <!-- Page 257 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page257"></a>{257}</span>object in the present work is to trace the
  past history of the more important islands by means of the forms of life
  that inhabit them, and as for this purpose plants are sometimes of more
  value than any class of animals, it will be well to take advantage of the
  valuable materials here available, in order to ascertain how far the
  evidence derived from the two organic kingdoms agrees in character; and
  also to obtain some general results which may be of service in our
  discussion of more difficult and more complex problems.</p>

  <p>There are in the Azores 480 known species of flowering-plants and
  ferns, of which no less than 440 are found also in Europe, Madeira, or
  the Canary Islands; while forty are peculiar to the Azores, but are more
  or less closely allied to European species. As botanists are no less
  prone than zoologists to invoke former land-connections and continental
  extensions to account for the wide dispersal of objects of their study,
  it will be well to examine somewhat closely what these facts really
  imply.</p>

  <p><i>The Dispersal of Seeds.</i>&mdash;The seeds of plants are liable to
  be dispersed by a greater variety of agents than any other organisms,
  while their tenacity of life, under varying conditions of heat and cold,
  drought and moisture, is also exceptionally great. They have also an
  advantage, in that the great majority of flowering plants have the sexes
  united in the same individual, so that a single seed in a state fit to
  germinate may easily stock a whole island. The dispersal of seeds has
  been studied by Sir Joseph Hooker, Mr. Darwin, and many other writers,
  who have made it sufficiently clear that they are in many cases liable to
  be carried enormous distances. An immense number are specially adapted to
  be carried by the wind, through the possession of down or hairs, or
  membranous wings or processes; while others are so minute, and produced
  in such profusion, that it is difficult to place a limit to the distance
  they might be carried by gales of wind or hurricanes. Another class of
  somewhat heavier seeds or dry fruits are capable of being exposed for a
  long time to sea-water without injury. Mr. Darwin made many experiments
  on this point, and he found that many seeds, especially of Atriplex, <!--
  Page 258 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258"></a>{258}</span>Beta,
  oats, Capsicum, and the potato, grew after 100 days' immersion, while a
  large number survived fifty days. But he also found that most of them
  sink after a few days' immersion, and this would certainly prevent them
  being floated to very great distances. It is very possible, however, that
  dried branches or flower-heads containing seeds would float longer, while
  it is quite certain that many tropical seeds do float for enormous
  distances, as witness the double cocoa-nuts which cross the Indian ocean
  from the Seychelle Islands to the coast of Sumatra, and the West Indian
  beans which frequently reach the west coast of Scotland. There is
  therefore ample evidence of the possibility of seeds being conveyed
  across the sea for great distances by winds and surface currents.<a
  name="NtA_104" href="#Nt_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Birds as Seed-carriers.</i>&mdash;The great variety of fruits that
  are eaten by birds afford a means of plant-dispersal in the fact that
  seeds often pass through the bodies of birds in a state well-fitted for
  germination; and such seeds may occasionally be carried long distances by
  this means. Of the twenty-two land-birds found in the Azores, half are,
  more or less, fruit-eaters, and these may have been the means of
  introducing many plants into the islands.</p>

  <p>Birds also frequently have small portions of earth on their feet; and
  Mr. Darwin has shown by actual experiment that almost all such earth
  contains seeds. Thus in <!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page259"></a>{259}</span>nine grains of earth on the leg of a
  woodcock a seed of the toad-rush was found which germinated; while a
  wounded red-legged partridge had a ball of earth weighing six and a half
  ounces adhering to its leg, and from this earth Mr. Darwin raised no less
  than eighty-two separate plants of about five distinct species. Still
  more remarkable was the experiment with six and three-quarter ounces of
  mud from the edge of a little pond, which, carefully treated under glass,
  produced 537 distinct plants! This is equal to a seed for every six
  grains of mud, and when we consider how many birds frequent the edges of
  ponds in search of food, or come there to drink, it is evident that great
  numbers of seeds may be dispersed by this means.</p>

  <p>Many seeds have hispid awns, hooks, or prickles which readily attach
  them to the feathers of birds, and a great number of aquatic birds nest
  inland on the ground; and as these are pre-eminently wanderers, they must
  often aid in the dispersal of such plants.<a name="NtA_105"
  href="#Nt_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 260 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page260"></a>{260}</span></p>

  <p><i>Facilities for Dispersal of Azorean Plants.</i>&mdash;Now in the
  course of very long periods of time the various causes here enumerated
  would be sufficient to stock the remotest islands with vegetation, and a
  considerable part of the Azorean flora appears well adapted to be so
  conveyed. Of the 439 flowering-plants in Mr. Watson's list, I find that
  about forty-five belong to genera that have either pappus or winged
  seeds; sixty-five to such as have very minute seeds; thirty have fleshy
  fruits such as are greedily eaten by birds; several have hispid seeds;
  and eighty-four are glumaceous plants, which are all probably
  well-adapted for being carried partly by winds and partly by currents, as
  well as by some of the other causes mentioned. On the other hand we have
  a very suggestive fact in the absence from the Azores of most of the
  trees and shrubs with large and heavy fruits, however common they may be
  in Europe. Such are oaks, chestnuts, hazels, apples, beeches, alders, and
  firs; while the only trees or large shrubs are the Portugal laurel,
  myrtle, laurestinus, elder, <i>Laurus canariensis</i>, <i>Myrica
  faya</i>, and a doubtfully peculiar juniper&mdash;all small
  berry-bearers, and therefore likely to have been conveyed by one or other
  of the modes suggested above.</p>

  <p>There can be little doubt that the truly indigenous flora of the
  islands is far more scanty than the number of plants recorded would
  imply, because a large but unknown proportion of the species are
  certainly importations, voluntary or involuntary, by man. As, however,
  the general character of the whole flora is that of the south-western
  peninsula of Europe, and as most of the introduced plants have come from
  the same country, it is almost impossible now to separate them, and Mr.
  Watson has not attempted to do so. The whole flora contains
  representatives of eighty natural orders and 250 genera: and even if we
  suppose that one-half the species only are truly indigenous, <!-- Page
  261 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page261"></a>{261}</span>there will
  still remain a wonderfully rich and varied flora to have been carried, by
  the various natural means above indicated, over 900 miles of ocean, more
  especially as the large proportion of species identical with those of
  Europe shows that their introduction has been comparatively recent, and
  that it is, probably (as in the case of the birds) still going on. We may
  therefore feel sure that we have here by no means reached the limit of
  distance to which plants can be conveyed by natural means across the
  ocean; and this conclusion will be of great value to us in investigating
  other cases where the evidence at our command is less complete, and the
  indications of origin more obscure or conflicting.</p>

  <p>Of the forty species which are considered to be peculiar to the
  islands, all are allied to European plants except six, whose nearest
  affinities are in the Canaries or Madeira. Two of the Compositæ are
  considered to be distinct genera, but in this order generic divisions
  rest on slight technical distinctions; and the <i>Campanula vidalii</i>
  is very distinct from any other known species. With these exceptions,
  most of the peculiar Azorean species are closely allied to European
  plants, and are in several cases little more than varieties of them.
  While therefore we may believe that the larger part of the existing flora
  reached the islands since the glacial epoch, a portion of it may be more
  ancient, as there is no doubt that a majority of the species could
  withstand some lowering of temperature; while in such a warm latitude and
  surrounded with sea, there would always be many sunny and sheltered spots
  in which even tender plants might flourish.</p>

  <p><i>Important Deduction from the Peculiarities of the Azorean Fauna and
  Flora.</i>&mdash;There is one conclusion to be drawn from the almost
  wholly European character of the Azorean fauna and flora which deserves
  special attention, namely, that the peopling of remote islands is not due
  so much to ordinary or normal, as to extraordinary and exceptional
  causes. These islands lie in the course of the south-westerly return
  trades and also of the Gulf Stream, and we should therefore naturally
  expect that American birds, insects, and plants would preponderate if
  they were <!-- Page 262 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page262"></a>{262}</span>conveyed by the regular winds and
  currents, which are both such as to prevent European species from
  reaching the islands. But the violent storms to which the Azores are
  liable blow from all points of the compass; and it is evidently to these,
  combined with the greater proximity and more favourable situation of the
  coasts of Europe and North Africa, that the presence of a fauna and flora
  so decidedly European is to be traced.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The other North Atlantic Islands&mdash;Madeira, the Canaries, and the
  Cape de Verdes&mdash;present analogous phenomena to those of the Azores,
  but with some peculiarities dependent on their more southern position,
  their richer vegetation, and perhaps their greater antiquity. These have
  been sufficiently discussed in my <i>Geographical Distribution of
  Animals</i> (Vol. I. pp. 208-215); and as we are now dealing with what
  may be termed typical examples of oceanic islands, for the purpose of
  illustrating the laws, and solving the problems presented by the
  dispersal of animals, we will pass on to other cases which have been less
  fully discussed in that work.</p>

<p class="cenhead">BERMUDA.</p>

  <p>The Bermudas are a small group of low islands formed of coral, and
  blown coral-sand consolidated into rock. They are situated in 32° N.
  Lat., about 700 miles from North Carolina, and somewhat farther from the
  Bahama Islands, and are thus rather more favourably placed for receiving
  immigrants from America and its islands than the Azores are with respect
  to Europe. There are about 100 islands and islets in all, but their total
  area does not exceed fifty square miles. They are surrounded by reefs,
  some at a distance of thirty miles from the main group; and the discovery
  of a layer of earth with remains of cedar-trees forty-eight feet below
  the present high-water mark shows that the islands have once been more
  extensive and probably included the whole area now occupied by shoals and
  reefs.<a name="NtA_106" href="#Nt_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> Immediately
  beyond these reefs, <!-- Page 263 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page263"></a>{263}</span>however, extends a very deep ocean, while
  about 450 miles distant in a south-east direction, the deepest part of
  the North Atlantic is reached, where soundings of 3,825 and 3,875 fathoms
  have been obtained. It is clear therefore that these islands are
  typically oceanic.</p>

  <p>Soundings were taken by the <i>Challenger</i> in four <!-- Page 264
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page264"></a>{264}</span>different
  directions around Bermuda, and always showed a rapid deepening of the sea
  to about 2,500 fathoms. This was so remarkable, that in his reports to
  the Admiralty, Captain Nares spoke of Bermuda as "a solitary peak rising
  abruptly from a base only 120 miles in diameter;" and in another place as
  "an isolated peak rising abruptly from a very small base." These
  expressions show that Bermuda is looked upon as a typical example of an
  "oceanic peak"; and on examining the series of official reports of the
  <i>Challenger</i> soundings, I can find no similar case, although some
  coasts, both of continents and islands, descend more abruptly. In order
  to show, therefore, what is the real character of this peak, I have drawn
  a section of it on a true scale from the soundings taken in a north and
  south direction where the descent is steepest. It will be seen that the
  slope is on both sides very easy, being 1 in 16 on the south, and 1 in 19
  on the north. The portion nearest the islands will slope more rapidly,
  perhaps reaching in places 1 in 10; but even this is not steeper than
  many country roads in hilly countries, while the remainder would be a
  hardly perceptible slope. Although generally very low, some parts of
  these islands rise to 250 feet above the sea-level, consisting of various
  kinds of limestone rock, sometimes soft and friable, but often very hard
  and even crystalline. It consists of beds which sometimes dip as much as
  30°, and which also show great contortions, so that at first sight the
  islands appear to exhibit on a small scale the phenomena of a disturbed
  Palæozoic district. It has however long been known that these rocks are
  all due to the wind, <!-- Page 265 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page265"></a>{265}</span>which blows up the fine calcareous sand,
  the product of the disintegration of coral, shells, serpulæ, and other
  organisms, forming sand-hills forty and fifty feet high, which move
  gradually along, overwhelming the lower tracts of land behind them. These
  are consolidated by the percolation of rain-water, which dissolves some
  of the lime from the more porous tracts and deposits it lower down,
  filling every fissure with stalagmite.</p>

    miles north and forty-six miles south of the islands respectively.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>The Red Clay of Bermuda.</i>&mdash;Besides the calcareous rocks
  there is found in many parts of the islands a layer of red earth or clay,
  containing about thirty per cent. of oxide of iron. This very closely
  resembles, both in colour and chemical composition, the red clay of the
  ocean floor, found widely spread in the Atlantic at depths of from 2,300
  to 3,150 fathoms, and occurring abundantly all round Bermuda. It appears,
  therefore, at first sight, as if the ocean bed itself has been here
  raised to the surface, and a portion of its covering of red clay
  preserved; and this is the view adopted by Mr. Jones in his paper on the
  "Botany of Bermuda." He says, after giving the analysis: "This analysis
  tends to convince us that the deep chocolate-coloured red clay of the
  islands found in the lower levels, and from high-water mark some distance
  into the sea, originally came from the ocean floor, and that when by
  volcanic agency the Bermuda column was raised from the depths of the sea,
  its summit, most probably broken in outline, appeared above the surface
  covered with this red mud, which in the course of ages has but slightly
  changed its composition, and yet possesses sufficient evidence to prove
  its identity with that now lying contiguous to the base of the Bermuda
  column." But in his <i>Guide to Bermuda</i> Mr. Jones tells us that this
  same red earth has been found, two feet thick, under coral rock at a
  depth of forty-two feet below low-water mark, and that it "rested on a
  bed of compact calcareous sandstone." Now it is quite certain that this
  "calcareous sandstone" was never formed at the bottom of the deep ocean
  700 miles from land; and the occurrence of the red earth at different
  levels upon coralline sand rock is therefore more probably due to some
  process of decomposition of the rock itself, <!-- Page 266 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page266"></a>{266}</span>or of the minute
  organisms which abound in the blown sand.<a name="NtA_107"
  href="#Nt_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Zoology of Bermuda.</i>&mdash;As might be expected from their
  extreme isolation, these islands possess no indigenous terrestrial
  mammalia, frogs, or snakes.<a name="NtA_108"
  href="#Nt_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a> There is however one lizard, which
  Professor Cope considers to be distinct from any American species, and
  which he has named <i>Plestiodon (Eumeces) longirostris</i>. It is said
  to be most nearly allied to <i>Eumeces quinquelineatus</i> of the
  south-eastern States, from which it differs in having nearly ten more
  rows of scales, the tail thicker, and the muzzle longer. In colour it is
  ashy brown above, greenish blue beneath, with a white line black-margined
  on the sides, and it seems to be tolerably abundant in the islands. This
  lizard is especially interesting as being the only vertebrate animal
  which exhibits any peculiarity.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;Notwithstanding its small size, low altitude and
  <!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page267"></a>{267}</span>remote position, a great number of birds
  visit Bermuda annually, some in large numbers, others only as accidental
  stragglers. Altogether, over 180 species have been recorded, rather more
  than half being wading and swimming birds, whose presence is not so much
  to be wondered at as they are great wanderers; while about eighty-five
  are land birds, many of which would hardly be supposed capable of flying
  so great a distance. Of the 180 species, however, about thirty have only
  been seen once, and a great many more are very rare; but about twenty
  species of land birds are recorded as tolerably frequent visitors, and
  nearly half these appear to come every year.</p>

  <p>There are only eleven species which are permanent residents on the
  island&mdash;eight land, and three water birds, and of these one has been
  almost certainly introduced. These resident birds are as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>1. <i>Galeoscoptes carolinensis.</i> (The Cat bird.) Migrates along
  the east coast of the United States.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Sialia sialis.</i> (The Blue bird.) Migrates along the east
  coast.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Vireo novæboracensis.</i> (The White-eyed green Tit.) Migrates
  along the east coast.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Passer domesticus.</i> (The English Sparrow.) ? Introduced.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Corvus americanus.</i> (The American Crow.) Common over all
  North America.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Cardinalis virginianus.</i> (The Cardinal bird.) Migrates from
  Carolina southward.</p>

  <p>7. <i>Cham&oelig;pelia passerina.</i> (The ground Dove.) Louisiana, W.
  Indies, and Mexico.</p>

  <p>8. <i>Ortyx virginianus.</i> (The American Quail.) New England to
  Florida.</p>

  <p>9. <i>Ardea herodias.</i> (The Great Blue Heron.) All North
  America.</p>

  <p>10. <i>Gailinula galeata.</i> (The Florida Gallinule.) Temperate and
  tropical North America.</p>

  <p>11. <i>Phäeton flavirostris.</i> (The Tropic Bird.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It will be seen that these are all very common North American birds,
  and most of them are constant visitors from the mainland, so that however
  long they may have inhabited the islands there has been no chance for
  them to have acquired any distinctive characters owing to the want of
  isolation.</p>

  <p>Among the most regular visitants which are not resident, are the
  common N. American kingfisher (<i>Ceryle alcyon</i>), <!-- Page 268
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>{268}</span>the night-hawk
  (<i>Chordeiles virginianus</i>), the wood wagtail (<i>Siurus
  novæboracensis</i>), the snow-bunting (<i>Plectrophanes nivalis</i>), and
  the wide-ranging rice-bird (<i>Dolichonyx oryzivora</i>), all very common
  and widespread in North America.</p>

  <p><i>Comparison of the Bird-faunas of Bermuda and the
  Azores.</i>&mdash;The bird-fauna of Bermuda thus differs from that of the
  Azores, in the much smaller number of resident species, and the presence
  of several regular migrants. This is due, first, to the small area and
  little varied surface of these islands, as well as to their limited flora
  and small supply of insects not affording conditions suitable for the
  residence of many species all the year round; and, secondly, to the
  peculiarity of the climate of North America, which causes a much larger
  number of its birds to be migratory than in Europe. The Northern United
  States and Canada, with a sunny climate, luxuriant vegetation, and
  abundant insect-life during the summer, supply food and shelter to an
  immense number of insectivorous and frugivorous birds; so that during the
  breeding season Canada is actually richer in bird-life than Florida. But
  as the severe winter comes on all these are obliged to migrate southward,
  some to Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, others as far as the West Indies,
  Mexico, or even to Guatemala and South America.</p>

  <p>Every spring and autumn, therefore a vast multitude of birds,
  belonging to more than a hundred distinct species, migrate northward or
  southward in Eastern America. A large proportion of these pass along the
  Atlantic coast, and it has been observed that many of them fly some
  distance out to sea, passing straight across bays from headland to
  headland by the shortest route.</p>

  <p>Now as the time of these migrations is the season of storms,
  especially the autumnal one, which nearly coincides with the hurricanes
  of the West Indies and the northerly gales of the coast of America, the
  migrating birds are very liable to be carried out to sea. Sometimes they
  may, as Mr. Jones suggests, be carried up by local whirlwinds to a great
  height, where meeting with a westerly or north-westerly gale, they are
  rapidly driven sea-ward. The great majority no doubt perish, but some
  reach the Bermudas <!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page269"></a>{269}</span>and form one of its most striking autumnal
  features. In October, Mr. Jones tells us, the sportsman enjoys more
  shooting than at any other time. The violent revolving gales, which occur
  almost weekly, bring numbers of birds of many species from the American
  continent, the different members of the duck tribe forming no
  inconsiderable portion of the whole; while the Canada goose, and even the
  ponderous American swan, have been seen amidst the migratory host. With
  these come also such delicate birds as the American robin (<i>Turdus
  migratorius</i>), the yellow-rumped warbler (<i>Dendr&oelig;ca
  coronata</i>), the pine warbler (<i>Dendr&oelig;ca pinus</i>), the wood
  wagtail (<i>Siurus novæboracensis</i>), the summer red bird (<i>Pyranga
  æstiva</i>), the snow-bunting (<i>Plectrophanes nivalis</i>), the
  red-poll (<i>Ægiothus linarius</i>), the king bird (<i>Tyrannus
  carolinensis</i>), and many others. It is no doubt in consequence of this
  repeated immigration that none of the Bermuda birds have acquired any
  special peculiarity constituting even a distinct variety; for the few
  species that are resident and breed in the islands are continually
  crossed by individual immigrants of the same species from the
  mainland.</p>

  <p>Four European birds also have occurred in Bermuda;&mdash;the wheatear
  (<i>Saxicola &oelig;nanthe</i>), which visits Iceland and Lapland and
  sometimes the northern United States; the skylark (<i>Alauda
  arvensis</i>), but this was probably an imported bird or an escape from
  some ship; the land-rail (<i>Crex pratensis</i>), which also wanders to
  Greenland and the United States; and the common snipe (<i>Scolopax
  gallinago</i>), which occurs not unfrequently in Greenland but has not
  yet been noticed in North America. It is however so like the American
  snipe (<i>S. wilsoni</i>), that a straggler might easily be
  overlooked.</p>

  <p>Two small bats of N. American species also occasionally reach the
  island, while two others from the West Indies have more rarely occurred,
  and these are the only wild mammalia except rats and mice.</p>

  <p><i>Insects of Bermuda.</i>&mdash;Insects appear to be very scarce; but
  it is evident from the lists given by Mr. Jones, and more recently by
  Professor Heilprin, that only the more conspicuous species have been yet
  collected. These <!-- Page 270 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page270"></a>{270}</span>comprise nineteen beetles, eleven bees and
  wasps, twenty-six butterflies and moths, nine flies, and the same number
  of Hemiptera, Orthoptera, and Neuroptera respectively. All appear to be
  common North American or West Indian species; but until some competent
  entomological collector visits the islands it is impossible to say
  whether there are or are not any peculiar species.<a name="NtA_109"
  href="#Nt_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Land Mollusca.</i>&mdash;The land-shells of the Bermudas are
  somewhat more interesting, as they appear to be the only group of animals
  except reptiles in which there are any peculiar species. The following
  list was kindly furnished me by Mr. Thomas Bland of New York, who has
  made a special study of the terrestrial molluscs of the West Indian
  Islands, from which those of the Bermudas have undoubtedly been derived.
  The nomenclature has been corrected in accordance with the list given in
  Professor Heilprin's work on the islands. The species which are peculiar
  to the islands are indicated by italics.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bland indicates only four species as certainly peculiar to
  Bermuda, and another sub-fossil species; while one or two of the
  remainder are indicated as doubtfully identical with those of other
  countries. We have thus about one-fifth of the land-shells peculiar,
  while almost all the other productions of the islands are identical with
  those of the adjacent continent and islands. This corresponds, however,
  with what occurs generally in islands at some distance from continents.
  In the Azores only one land-bird is peculiar out of eighteen resident
  species; the beetles show about one-eighth of the probably non-introduced
  species as peculiar; the plants about one-twentieth; while the
  land-shells have about half the species peculiar. This difference is well
  explained by the much greater difficulty of transmission over wide seas,
  in the case of land-shells, than of any other terrestrial organisms. It
  thus happens that when a species has once been conveyed it may remain
  isolated for unknown ages, and has time to become modified by local
  conditions unchecked by the introduction of other individuals of the
  original type.</p>

  <p><i>Flora of Bermuda.</i>&mdash;Unfortunately no good account of the
  plants of these islands has yet been published. Mr. <!-- Page 272
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272"></a>{272}</span>Jones, in his
  paper "On the Vegetation of the Bermudas" gives a list of no less than
  480 species of flowering plants; but this number includes all the
  culinary plants, fruit-trees, and garden flowers, as well as all the
  ornamental trees and shrubs from various parts of the world which have
  been introduced, mixed up with the European and American weeds that have
  come with agricultural or garden seeds, and the really indigenous plants,
  in one undistinguished series. It appears too, that the late Governor,
  Major-General Lefroy, "has sown and distributed throughout the islands
  packets of seeds from Kew, representing no less than 600 species,
  principally of trees and shrubs suited to sandy coast soils"&mdash;so
  that it will be more than ever difficult in future years to distinguish
  the indigenous from the introduced vegetation.</p>

  <p>From the researches of Dr. Rein and Mr. Moseley there appear to be
  about 250 flowering plants in a wild state, and of these Mr. Moseley
  thinks less than half are indigenous. The majority are tropical and West
  Indian, while others are common to the Southern States of North America;
  the former class having been largely brought by means of the Gulf Stream,
  the latter by the agency of birds or by winds. Mr. Jones tells us that
  the currents bring numberless objects animate and inanimate from the
  Carribean Sea, including the seeds of trees, shrubs, and other plants,
  which are continually cast ashore and sometimes vegetate. The soap-berry
  tree (<i>Sapindus saponaria</i>) has been actually observed to originate
  in this way.</p>

  <p>The only <i>species</i> of flowering plant peculiar to Bermuda is
  <i>Carex Bermudiana</i> (Hemsley), which is said to be allied to a
  species found only in St. Helena; but there are some local forms of
  continental species, among which are <i>Sisyrinchium Bermudianum</i> and
  a variety of <i>Rhus toxicodendron</i>. There are, however, two
  ferns&mdash;an Adiantum and a Nephrodium, which are unknown from any
  other locality. The juniper, which is so conspicuous a feature of the
  islands, is said to be a West Indian species (<i>Juniperus
  barbadensis</i>) found in Jamaica and the Bahamas, not the North American
  red <!-- Page 273 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page273"></a>{273}</span>cedar; but there seems to be still some
  doubt about this common plant.</p>

  <p>Mr. Moseley, who visited Bermuda in the <i>Challenger</i>, has well
  explained the probable origin of the vegetation. The large number of West
  Indian plants is no doubt due to the Gulf Stream and constant surface
  drift of warm water in this direction, while others have been brought by
  the annual cyclones which sweep over the intervening ocean. The great
  number of American migratory birds, including large flocks of the
  American golden plover, with ducks and other aquatic species, no doubt
  occasionally bring seeds, either in the mud attached to their feet or in
  their stomachs.<a name="NtA_111" href="#Nt_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> As
  these causes are either constantly in action or recur annually, it is not
  surprising that almost all the species should be unchanged owing to the
  frequent intercrossing of freshly-arrived specimens. If a competent
  botanist were thoroughly to explore Bermuda, eliminate the species
  introduced by human agency, and investigate the source from whence the
  others were derived and the mode by which they had reached so remote an
  island, we should obtain important information as to the dispersal of
  plants, which might afford us a clue to the solution of many difficult
  problems in their geographical distribution.</p>

  <p><i>Concluding Remarks.</i>&mdash;The two groups of islands we have now
  been considering furnish us with some most instructive facts as to the
  power of many groups of organisms to pass over from 700 to 900 miles of
  open sea. There is no doubt whatever that all the indigenous species have
  thus reached these islands, and in many cases the process may be seen
  going on from year to year. We find that, as regards birds, migratory
  habits and the liability to be caught by violent storms are the
  conditions which determine the island-population. In both islands the
  land-birds are almost exclusively migrants; and in both, the
  non-migratory groups&mdash;wrens, tits, creepers, and
  nuthatches&mdash;are absent; while the number of annual visitors is
  greater in proportion as the migratory habits and prevalence of storms
  afford more efficient means for their introduction. <!-- Page 274
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page274"></a>{274}</span></p>

  <p>We find also, that these great distances do not prevent the
  immigration of some insects of most of the orders, and especially of a
  considerable number and variety of beetles; while even land-shells are
  fairly represented in both islands, the large proportion of peculiar
  species clearly indicating that, as we might expect, individuals of this
  group of organisms arrive only at long and irregular intervals.</p>

  <p>Plants are represented by a considerable variety of orders and genera,
  most of which show some special adaptation for dispersal by wind or
  water, or through the medium of birds; and there is no reason to doubt
  that besides the species that have actually established themselves, many
  others must have reached the islands, but were either not suited to the
  climate and other physical conditions, or did not find the insects
  necessary to their fertilisation, and were therefore unable to maintain
  themselves.</p>

  <p>If now we consider the extreme remoteness and isolation of these
  islands, their small area and comparatively recent origin, and that,
  notwithstanding all these disadvantages, they have acquired a very
  considerable and varied flora and fauna, we shall, I think, be convinced,
  that with a larger area and greater antiquity, mere separation from a
  continent by many hundred miles of sea would not prevent a country from
  acquiring a very luxuriant and varied flora, and a fauna also rich and
  peculiar as regards all classes except terrestrial mammals, amphibia, and
  some groups of reptiles. This conclusion will be of great importance in
  those cases where the evidence as to the exact origin of the fauna and
  flora of an island is less clear and satisfactory than in the case of the
  Azores and Bermuda.</p>

  <p>The Galapagos differ in many important respects from the islands we
  have examined in our last chapter, and the differences are such as to
  have affected the whole character of their animal inhabitants. Like the
  Azores, they are volcanic, but they are much more extensive, the islands
  being both larger and more numerous; while volcanic action has been so
  recent that a large portion of their surface consists of barren
  lava-fields. They are considerably less distant from a continent than
  either the Azores or Bermuda, being about 600 miles from the west coast
  of South America and a little more than 700 from Veragua, with the small
  Cocos Islands intervening; and they are situated on the equator instead
  of being in the north temperate zone. They stand upon a deeply submerged
  bank, the 1,000 fathom line encircling all the more important islands at
  a few miles distance, whence there appears to be a comparatively steep
  descent all round to the average depth of that portion of the Pacific,
  between 2,000 and 3,000 fathoms. <!-- Page 276 --><span

  <p>The whole group occupies a space of about 300 by 200 miles. It
  consists of five large and twelve small islands; the largest (Albemarle
  Island) being about eighty miles long and of very irregular shape, while
  the four next in importance&mdash;Chatham, Indefatigable, James, and
  Narborough Islands, are each about twenty-five or thirty miles <!-- Page
  277 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"></a>{277}</span>long, and
  of a rounded or elongate form. The whole are entirely volcanic, and in
  the western islands there are numerous active volcanoes. Unlike the other
  groups of islands we have been considering, these are situated in a
  comparatively calm sea, where storms are of rare occurrence and even
  strong winds almost unknown. They are traversed by ocean currents which
  are strong and constant, flowing towards the north-west from the coast of
  Peru; <!-- Page 278 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page278"></a>{278}</span>and these physical conditions have had a
  powerful influence on the animal and vegetable forms by which the islands
  are now inhabited. The Galapagos have also, during three centuries, been
  frequently visited by Europeans, and were long a favourite resort of
  buccaneers and traders, who found an ample supply of food in the large
  tortoises which abound there; and to these visits we may perhaps trace
  the introduction of some animals whose presence it is otherwise difficult
  to account for. The vegetation is generally scanty, but still amply
  sufficient for the support of a considerable amount of animal life, as
  shown by the cattle, horses, asses, goats, pigs, dogs, and cats, which
  now run wild in some of the islands.</p>

</table>

  <p><i>Absence of Indigenous Mammalia and Amphibia.</i>&mdash;As in all
  other oceanic islands, we find here no truly indigenous mammalia, for
  though there is a mouse of the American genus Hesperomys, which differs
  somewhat from any known species, we can hardly consider this to be
  indigenous; first, because these creatures have been little studied in
  South America, and there may yet be many undescribed species, and in the
  second place because even had it been introduced by some European or
  native vessel, there is ample time in two or three hundred years for the
  very different conditions to have established a marked diversity in the
  characters of the species. This is the more probable because there is
  also a true rat of the Old World genus Mus, which is said to differ
  slightly from any known species; and as this genus is not a native of the
  American continents we are sure that it must have been recently
  introduced into the Galapagos. There can be little doubt therefore that
  the islands are completely destitute of truly indigenous mammalia; and
  frogs and toads, the only tropical representatives of the Amphibia, are
  equally unknown.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;Reptiles, however, which at first sight appear
  as unsuited as mammals to pass over a wide expanse of ocean, abound in
  the Galapagos, though the species are not very numerous. They consist of
  land-tortoises, lizards and snakes. The tortoises consist of two peculiar
  species, <i>Testudo microphyes</i>, found in most of the islands, and
  <i>T. <!-- Page 279 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page279"></a>{279}</span>abingdonii</i> recently discovered on
  Abingdon Island, as well as one extinct species, <i>T. ephippium</i>,
  found on Indefatigable Island. These are all of very large size, like the
  gigantic tortoises of the Mascarene Islands, from which, however, they
  differ in structural characters; and Dr. Günther believes that they have
  been originally derived from the American continent.<a name="NtA_112"
  href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> Considering the well known tenacity
  of life of these animals, and the large number of allied forms which have
  aquatic or sub-aquatic habits, it is not a very extravagant supposition
  that some ancestral form, carried out to sea by a flood, was once or
  twice safely drifted as far as the Galapagos, and thus originated the
  races which now inhabit them.</p>

  <p>The lizards are five in number; a peculiar species of gecko,
  <i>Phyllodactylus galapagensis</i>, and four species of the American
  family Iguanidæ. Two of these are distinct species of the genus
  Tropidurus, the other two being large, and so very distinct as to be
  classed in peculiar genera. One of these is aquatic and found in all the
  islands, swimming in the sea at some distance from the shore and feeding
  on seaweed; the other is terrestrial, and is confined to the four central
  islands. These last were originally described as <i>Amblyrhynchus
  cristatus</i> by Mr. Bell, and <i>A. subcristatus</i> by Gray; they were
  afterwards placed in two other genera Trachycephalus and Oreocephalus
  (<i>see</i> Brit. Mus. Catalogue of Lizards), while in a recent paper by
  Dr. Steindachner, the marine species is again classed as Amblyrhynchus,
  while the terrestrial form is placed in another genus Conolophus, both
  genera being peculiar to the Galapagos.</p>

  <p>How these lizards reached the islands we cannot tell. The fact that
  they all belong to American genera or families indicates their derivation
  from that continent, while their being all distinct species is a proof
  that their arrival took place at a remote epoch, under conditions perhaps
  somewhat different from any which now prevail. It is certain that animals
  of this order have some means of crossing the sea not possessed by any
  other land vertebrates, <!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page280"></a>{280}</span>since they are found in a considerable
  number of islands which possess no mammals nor any other land reptiles;
  but what those means are has not yet been positively ascertained.</p>

  <p>It is unusual for oceanic islands to possess snakes, and it is
  therefore somewhat of an anomaly that two species are found in the
  Galapagos. Both are closely allied to South American forms, and one is
  hardly different from a Chilian snake, so that they indicate a more
  recent origin than in the case of the lizards. Snakes it is known can
  survive a long time at sea, since a living boa-constrictor once reached
  the island of St. Vincent from the coast of South America, a distance of
  two hundred miles by the shortest route. Snakes often frequent trees, and
  might thus be conveyed long distances if carried out to sea on a tree
  uprooted by a flood such as often occurs in tropical climates and
  especially during earthquakes. To some such accident we may perhaps
  attribute the presence of these creatures in the Galapagos, and that it
  is a very rare one is indicated by the fact that only two species have as
  yet succeeded in obtaining a footing there.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;We now come to the birds, whose presence here may
  not seem so remarkable, but which yet present features of interest not
  exceeded by any other group. About seventy species of birds have now been
  obtained on these islands, and of these forty-one are peculiar to them.
  But all the species found elsewhere, except one, belong to the aquatic
  tribes or the waders which are pre-eminently wanderers, yet even of these
  eight are peculiar. The true land-birds are forty-two in number, and all
  but one are entirely confined to the Galapagos; while three-fourths of
  them present such peculiarities that they are classed in distinct genera.
  All are allied to birds inhabiting tropical America, some very closely;
  while one&mdash;the common American rice-bird which ranges over the whole
  northern and part of the southern continents&mdash;is the only land-bird
  identical with those of the mainland. The following is a list of these
  land-birds taken from Mr. Salvin's memoir in the <i>Transactions of the
  Zoological Society</i> for the year 1876, to which are added nine species
  collected in 1888 and <!-- Page 281 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page281"></a>{281}</span>described by Mr. Ridgway in the
  <i>Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum</i> (XII. p. 101) and some
  additional species obtained in 1889.</p>

  <p>We have here every gradation of difference from perfect identity with
  the continental species to genera so distinct that it is difficult to
  determine with what forms they are most nearly allied; and it is
  interesting to note that this diversity bears a distinct relation to the
  probabilities of, and facilities for, migration to the islands. The
  excessively abundant rice-bird, which breeds in Canada and swarms over
  the whole United States, migrating to the West Indies and South America,
  visiting the distant Bermudas almost every year, and extending its range
  as far as Paraguay, is the only species of land-bird which remains
  completely unchanged in the Galapagos; and we may therefore conclude that
  some stragglers of the migrating host reach the islands sufficiently
  often to keep up the purity of the breed. Next, we have the almost
  cosmopolite short-eared owl (<i>Asio brachyotus</i>), which ranges from
  China to Ireland, and from Greenland to the Straits of Magellan, and of
  this the Galapagos bird is probably only one of the numerous varieties.
  The little wood warbler (<i>Dendr&oelig;ca aureola</i>) is closely allied
  to a species which <!-- Page 283 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page283"></a>{283}</span>ranges over the whole of North America and
  as far south as New Grenada. It has also been occasionally met with in
  Bermuda, an indication that it has considerable powers of flight and
  endurance. The more distinct <i>species</i>&mdash;as the tyrant
  fly-catchers (Pyrocephalus and Myiarchus), the ground-dove (Zenaida), and
  the buzzard (Buteo), are all allied to non-migratory species peculiar to
  tropical America, and of a more restricted range; while the distinct
  <i>genera</i> are allied to South American groups of thrushes, finches,
  and sugar-birds which have usually restricted ranges, and whose habits
  are such as not to render them likely to be carried out to sea. The
  remote ancestral forms of these birds which, owing to some exceptional
  causes, reached the Galapagos, have thus remained uninfluenced by later
  migrations, and have, in consequence, been developed into a variety of
  distinct types adapted to the peculiar conditions of existence under
  which they have been placed. Sometimes the different species thus formed
  are confined to one or two of the islands only, as the three species of
  Certhidea, which are divided between the islands but do not appear ever
  to occur together. <i>Nesomimus parvulus</i> is confined to Albemarle
  Island, and <i>N. trifasciatus</i> to Charles Island; <i>Cactornis
  pallida</i> to Indefatigable Island, <i>C. brevirostris</i> to Chatham
  Island, and <i>C. abingdoni</i> to Abingdon Island.</p>

  <p>Now all these phenomena are strictly consistent with the theory of the
  peopling of the islands by accidental migrations, if we only allow them
  to have existed for a sufficiently long period; and the fact that
  volcanic action has ceased on many of the islands, as well as their great
  extent, would certainly indicate a considerable antiquity.</p>

  <p>The great difference presented by the birds of these islands as
  compared with those of the equally remote Azores and Bermudas, is
  sufficiently explained by the difference of climatal conditions. At the
  Galapagos there are none of those periodic storms, gales, and hurricanes
  which prevail in the North Atlantic, and which every year carry some
  straggling birds of Europe or North America to the former islands; while,
  at the same time, the majority of the tropical American birds are <!--
  Page 284 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page284"></a>{284}</span>nonmigratory, and thus afford none of the
  opportunities presented by the countless hosts of migrants which pass
  annually northward and southward along the European, and especially along
  the North American coasts. It is strictly in accordance with these
  different conditions that we find in one case an almost perfect identity
  with, and in the other an almost equally complete diversity from, the
  continental species of birds.</p>

  <p><i>Insects and Land-shells.</i>&mdash;The other groups of land-animals
  add little of importance to the facts already referred to. The insects
  are very scanty; the most plentiful group, the beetles, only furnishing
  about forty species belonging to thirty-two genera and nineteen families.
  The species are almost all peculiar, as are some of the genera. They are
  mostly small and obscure insects, allied either to American or to
  world-wide groups. The Carabidæ and the Heteromera are the most abundant
  groups, the former furnishing six and the latter nine species.<a
  name="NtA_113" href="#Nt_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 285 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page285"></a>{285}</span></p>

  <p>The land-shells are not abundant&mdash;about twenty in all, most of
  them peculiar species, but not otherwise remarkable. The observation of
  Captain Collnet, quoted by Mr. Darwin in his <i>Journal</i>, that
  drift-wood, bamboos, canes, and the nuts of a palm, are often washed on
  the south-eastern shores of the islands, furnishes an excellent clue to
  the manner in which many of the insects and land-shells may have reached
  the Galapagos. Whirlwinds also have been known to carry quantities of
  leaves and other vegetable <i>débris</i> to great heights in the air, and
  these might be then carried away by strong upper currents and dropped at
  great distances, and with them small insects and mollusca, or their eggs.
  We must also remember that volcanic islands are subject to subsidence as
  well as elevation; and it is quite possible that during the long period
  the Galapagos have existed some islands may have intervened between them
  and the coast, and have served as stepping-stones by which the passage to
  them of various organisms would be greatly facilitated. Sunken banks, the
  relics of such islands, are known to exist in many parts of the ocean,
  and countless others, no doubt, remain undiscovered.</p>

  <p><i>The Keeling Islands as Illustrating the Manner in which Oceanic
  Islands are Peopled.</i>&mdash;That such causes as have been here adduced
  are those by which oceanic islands have been peopled, is further shown by
  the condition of equally remote islands which we know are of
  comparatively recent origin. Such are the Keeling or Cocos Islands in the
  Indian Ocean, situated about the same distance from Sumatra as the
  Galapagos from South America, but mere coral reefs, supporting abundance
  of cocoa-nut palms as their chief vegetation. These islands were visited
  by Mr. <!-- Page 286 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page286"></a>{286}</span>Darwin, and their natural history
  carefully examined. The only mammals are rats, brought by a wrecked
  vessel and said by Mr. Waterhouse to be common English rats, "but smaller
  and more brightly coloured;" so that we have here an illustration of how
  soon a difference of race is established under a constant and uniform
  difference of conditions. There are no true land-birds, but there are
  snipes and rails, both apparently common Malayan species. Reptiles are
  represented by one small lizard, but no account of this is given in the
  <i>Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle</i>, and we may therefore conclude
  that it was an introduced species. Of insects, careful collecting only
  produced thirteen species belonging to eight distinct orders. The only
  beetle was a small Elater, the Orthoptera were a Gryllus and a Blatta;
  and there were two flies, two ants, and two small moths, one a Diopæa
  which swarms everywhere in the eastern tropics in grassy places. All
  these insects were no doubt brought either by winds, by floating timber
  (which reaches the islands abundantly), or by clinging to the feathers of
  aquatic or wading birds; and we only require more time to introduce a
  greater variety of species, and a better soil and more varied vegetation,
  to enable them to live and multiply, in order to give these islands a
  fauna and flora equal to that of the Bermudas. Of wild plants there were
  only twenty species, belonging to nineteen genera and to no less than
  sixteen natural families, while all were common tropical shore plants.<a
  name="NtA_114" href="#Nt_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> These islands are thus
  evidently stocked by waifs and strays brought by the winds and waves; but
  their scanty vegetation is mainly due to unfavourable
  conditions&mdash;the barren coral rock and sand, of which they are wholly
  composed, together with exposure to sea-air, being suitable to a very
  limited number of species which soon monopolise the surface. With more
  variety of soil and aspect a greater variety of plants would establish
  themselves, and these would favour the preservation and increase of more
  insects, birds, and <!-- Page 287 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page287"></a>{287}</span>other animals, as we find to be the case
  in many small and remote islands.<a name="NtA_115"
  href="#Nt_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Flora of the Galapagos.</i>&mdash;The plants of these islands are
  so much more numerous than the known animals, even including the insects,
  they have been so carefully studied by eminent botanists, and their
  relations throw so much light on the past history of the group, that no
  apology is needed for giving a brief outline of the peculiarities and
  affinities of the flora. The statements we shall make on this subject
  will be taken from the Memoir of Sir Joseph Hooker in the <i>Linnæan
  Transactions</i> for 1851, founded on Mr. Darwin's collections, and a
  later paper by N.&nbsp;J. Andersson in the <i>Linnæa</i> of 1861, embodying
  more recent discoveries. <!-- Page 288 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page288"></a>{288}</span></p>

  <p>The total number of flowering plants known at the latter date was 332,
  of which 174 were peculiar to the islands, while 158 were common to other
  countries.<a name="NtA_116" href="#Nt_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a> Of these
  latter about twenty have been introduced by man, while the remainder are
  all natives of some part of America, though about a third part are
  species of wide range extending into both hemispheres. Of those confined
  to America, forty-two are found in both the northern and southern
  continents, twenty-one are confined to South America, while twenty are
  found only in North America, the West Indies, or Mexico. This equality of
  North American and South American species in the Galapagos is a fact of
  great significance in connection with the observation of Sir Joseph
  Hooker that the <i>peculiar</i> species are allied to the plants of
  temperate America or to those of the high Andes, while the non-peculiar
  species are mostly such as inhabit the hotter regions of the tropics near
  the level of the sea. He also observes that the seeds of this latter
  class of Galapagos plants often have special means of transport, or
  belong to groups whose seeds are known to stand long voyages and to
  possess great vitality. Mr. Bentham also, in his elaborate account of the
  Compositæ,<a name="NtA_117" href="#Nt_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> remarks
  on the decided Central American or Mexican affinities of the Galapagos
  species, so that we may consider this to be a thoroughly well-established
  fact.</p>

  <p>The most prevalent families of plants in the Galapagos are the
  Compositæ (40 sp.), Gramineæ (32 sp.), Leguminosæ (30 sp.), and
  Euphorbiaceæ (29 sp.). Of the Compositæ most of the species, except such
  as are common weeds or shore plants, are peculiar, but there are only two
  peculiar genera, allied to Mexican forms and not very distinct; while the
  genus Lipochæta, represented here by a single species, is only found
  elsewhere in the Sandwich Islands though it has American affinities.</p>

  <p><i>Origin of the Galapagos Flora.</i>&mdash;These facts are explained
  by the past history of the American continent, its <!-- Page 289 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page289"></a>{289}</span>separation at various
  epochs by arms of the sea uniting the two oceans across what is now
  Central America (the last separation being of recent date, as shown by
  the considerable number of identical species of fishes on both sides of
  the isthmus), and the influence of the glacial epoch in driving the
  temperate American flora southward along the mountain plateaus.<a
  name="NtA_118" href="#Nt_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> At the time when the
  two oceans were united a portion of the Gulf Stream may have been
  diverted into the Pacific, giving rise to a current, some part of which
  would almost certainly have reached the Galapagos, and this may have
  helped to bring about that singular assemblage of West Indian and Mexican
  plants now found there. And as we now believe that the duration of the
  last glacial epoch in its successive phases was much longer than the time
  which has elapsed since it finally passed away, while throughout the
  Miocene epoch the snow-line would often be lowered during periods of high
  excentricity, we are enabled to comprehend the nature of the causes which
  may have led to the islands being stocked with those north tropical or
  mountain types which are so characteristic a feature of that portion of
  the Galapagos flora which consists of peculiar species.</p>

  <p>On the whole, the flora agrees with the fauna in indicating a
  moderately remote origin, great isolation, and changes of conditions
  affording facilities for the introduction of organisms from various parts
  of the American coast, and even from the West Indian Islands and Gulf of
  Mexico. As in the case of the birds, the several islands differ
  considerably in their native plants, many species being limited to one or
  two islands only, while others extend to several. This is, of course,
  what might be expected on any theory of their origin; because, even if
  the whole of the islands had once been united and afterwards separated,
  long continued isolation would often lead to the differentiation of
  species, while the varied conditions to be found upon islands differing
  in size and altitude as well as in luxuriance of vegetation, would often
  lead to the extinction of a species on one island and its preservation on
  another. If the several islands had been equally well <!-- Page 290
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page290"></a>{290}</span>explored, it
  might be interesting to see whether, as in the case of the Azores, the
  number of species diminished in those more remote from the coast; but
  unfortunately our knowledge of the productions of the various islands of
  the group is exceedingly unequal, and, except in those cases in which
  representative species inhabit distinct islands, we have no certainty on
  the subject. All the more interesting problems in geographical
  distribution, however, arise from the relation of the fauna and flora of
  the group as a whole to those of the surrounding continents, and we shall
  therefore for the most part confine ourselves to this aspect of the
  question in our discussion of the phenomena presented by oceanic or
  continental islands.</p>

  <p><i>Concluding Remarks.</i>&mdash;The Galapagos offer an instructive
  contrast with the Azores, showing how a difference of conditions that
  might be thought unimportant may yet produce very striking results in the
  forms of life. Although the Galapagos are much nearer a continent than
  the Azores, the number of species of plants common to the continent is
  much less in the former case than in the latter, and this is still more
  prominent a characteristic of the insect and the bird faunas. This
  difference has been shown to depend, almost entirely, on the one
  archipelago being situated in a stormy, the other in a calm portion of
  the ocean; and it demonstrates the preponderating importance of the
  atmosphere as an agent in the dispersal of birds, insects, and plants.
  Yet ocean-currents and surface-drifts are undoubtedly efficient carriers
  of plants, and, with plants, of insects and shells, especially in the
  tropics; and it is probably to this agency that we may impute the recent
  introduction of a number of common Peruvian and Chilian littoral species,
  and also of several West Indian types at a more remote period when the
  Isthmus of Panama was submerged.</p>

  <p>In the case of these islands we see the importance of taking account
  of past conditions of sea and land and past changes of climate, in order
  to explain the relations of the peculiar or endemic species of their
  fauna and flora; and we may even see an indication of the effects of
  climatal changes in the northern hemisphere, in the north <!-- Page 291
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page291"></a>{291}</span>temperate or
  alpine affinities of many of the plants, and even of some of the birds.
  The relation between the migratory habits of the birds and the amount of
  difference from continental types is strikingly accordant with the fact
  that it is almost exclusively migratory birds that annually reach the
  Azores and Bermuda; while the corresponding fact that the seeds of those
  plants, which are common to the Galapagos and the adjacent continent,
  have all&mdash;as Sir Joseph Hooker states&mdash;some special means of
  dispersal, is equally intelligible. The reason why the Galapagos possess
  four times as many peculiar species of plants as the Azores is clearly a
  result of the less constant introduction of seeds, owing to the absence
  of storms; the greater antiquity of the group, allowing more time for
  specific change; and the influence of cold epochs and of alterations of
  sea and land, in bringing somewhat different sets of plants at different
  times within the influence of such modified winds and currents as might
  convey them to the islands.</p>

  <p>On the whole, then, we have no difficulty in explaining the probable
  origin of the flora and fauna of the Galapagos, by means of the
  illustrative facts and general principles already adduced.</p>

  <p>In order to illustrate as completely as possible the peculiar

  combine in a higher degree than any other spots upon the globe, extreme
  isolation from all more extensive lands, with a tolerably rich fauna and
  flora whose peculiarities are of surpassing interest. Both, too, have
  received considerable attention from naturalists; and though much still
  remains to be done in the latter group, our knowledge is sufficient to
  enable us to arrive at many interesting results.</p>

  <p><i>Position and Physical Features of St. Helena.</i>&mdash;This island
  is situated nearly in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean, being more
  than 1,100 miles from the coast of Africa, and 1,800 from South America.
  It is about ten miles long by eight wide, and is wholly volcanic,
  consisting of ancient basalts, lavas, and other volcanic products. It is
  very mountainous and rugged, bounded for <!-- Page 294 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page294"></a>{294}</span>the most part by
  enormous precipices, and rising to a height of 2,700 feet above the
  sea-level. An ancient crater, about four miles across, is open on the
  south side, and its northern rim forms the highest and central ridge of
  the island. Many other hills and peaks, however, are more than two
  thousand feet high, and a considerable portion of the surface consists of
  a rugged plateau, having an elevation of about fifteen hundred to two
  thousand feet. Everything indicates that St. Helena is an isolated
  volcanic mass built up from the depths of the ocean. Mr. Wollaston
  remarks: "There are the strongest reasons for believing that the area of
  St. Helena was never <i>very</i> much larger than it is at
  present&mdash;the comparatively shallow sea-soundings within about a mile
  and a half from the shore revealing an abruptly defined ledge,
  <i>beyond</i> which no bottom is reached at a depth of 250 fathoms; so
  that the original basaltic mass, which was gradually piled up by means of
  successive eruptions from beneath the ocean, would appear to have its
  limit definitely marked out by this suddenly-terminating submarine
  cliff&mdash;the space between it and the existing coast-line being
  reasonably referred to that slow process of disintegration by which the
  island has been reduced, through the eroding action of the elements, to
  its present dimensions." If we add to this that between the island and
  the coast of Africa, in a south-easterly direction, is a profound oceanic
  gulf known to reach a depth of 2,860 fathoms, or 17,160 feet, while an
  equally deep, or perhaps deeper, ocean, extends to the west and
  south-west, we shall be satisfied that St. Helena is a true oceanic
  island, and that it owes none of its peculiarities to a former union with
  any continent or other distant land.</p>

  <p><i>Change Effected by European Occupation.</i>&mdash;When first
  discovered, in the year 1501, St. Helena was densely covered with a
  luxuriant forest vegetation, the trees overhanging the seaward precipices
  and covering every part of the surface with an evergreen mantle. This
  indigenous vegetation has been almost wholly destroyed; and although an
  immense number of foreign plants have been introduced, and have more or
  less completely established themselves, <!-- Page 295 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page295"></a>{295}</span>yet the general aspect
  of the island is now so barren and forbidding that some persons find it
  difficult to believe that it was once all green and fertile. The cause of
  the change is, however, very easily explained. The rich soil formed by
  decomposed volcanic rock and vegetable deposits could only be retained on
  the steep slopes so long as it was protected by the vegetation to which
  it in great part owed its origin. When this was destroyed, the heavy
  tropical rains soon washed away the soil, and has left a vast expanse of
  bare rock or sterile clay. This irreparable destruction was caused in the
  first place by goats, which were introduced by the Portuguese in 1513,
  and increased so rapidly that in 1588, they existed in thousands. These
  animals are the greatest of all foes to trees, because they eat off the
  young seedlings, and thus prevent the natural restoration of the forest.
  They were, however, aided by the reckless waste of man. The East India
  Company took possession of the island in 1651, and about the year 1700 it
  began to be seen that the forests were fast diminishing, and required
  some protection. Two of the native trees, redwood and ebony, were good
  for tanning, and to save trouble the bark was wastefully stripped from
  the trunks only, the remainder being left to rot; while in 1709 a large
  quantity of the rapidly disappearing ebony was used to burn lime for
  building fortifications! By the MSS. records quoted in Mr. Melliss'
  interesting volume on St. Helena,<a name="NtA_119"
  href="#Nt_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> it is evident that the evil
  consequences of allowing the trees to be destroyed were clearly foreseen,
  as the following passages show: "We find the place called the Great Wood
  in a flourishing condition, full of young trees, where the hoggs (of
  which there is a great abundance) do not come to root them up. But the
  Great Wood is miserably lessened and destroyed within our memories, and
  is not near the circuit and length it was. But we believe it does not
  contain now less than fifteen hundred acres of fine woodland and good
  ground, but no springs of water but what is salt or brackish, which we
  take to be the reason that that part was not inhabited when the people
  first <!-- Page 296 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page296"></a>{296}</span>chose out their settlements and made
  plantations; but if wells could be sunk, which the governor says he will
  attempt when we have more hands, we should then think it the most
  pleasant and healthiest part of the island. But as to healthiness, we
  don't think it will hold so if the wood that keeps the land warm were
  destroyed, for then the rains, which are violent here, would carry away
  the upper soil, and it being a clay marl underneath would produce but
  little; as it is, we think in case it were enclosed it might be greatly
  improved" ... "When once this wood is gone the island will soon be
  ruined" ... "We viewed the wood's end which joins the Honourable
  Company's plantation called the Hutts, but the wood is so destroyed that
  the beginning of the Great Wood is now a whole mile beyond that place,
  and all the soil between being washed away, that distance is now entirely
  barren." (MSS. records, 1716.) In 1709 the governor reported to the Court
  of Directors of the East India Company that the timber was rapidly
  disappearing, and that the goats should be destroyed for the preservation
  of the ebony wood, and because the island was suffering from droughts.
  The reply was, "The goats are not to be destroyed, being more valuable
  than ebony." Thus, through the gross ignorance of those in power, the
  last opportunity of preserving the peculiar vegetation of St. Helena, and
  preventing the island from becoming the comparatively rocky desert it now
  is, was allowed to pass away.<a name="NtA_120"
  href="#Nt_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> Even in a mere <!-- Page 297 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page297"></a>{297}</span>pecuniary point of view
  the error was a fatal one, for in the next century (in 1810) another
  governor reports the total destruction of the great forests by the goats,
  and that in consequence the cost of importing fuel for government use was
  2,729<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for a single year! About this time
  large numbers of European, American, Australian, and South African plants
  were imported, and many of these ran wild and increased so rapidly as to
  drive out and exterminate much of the relics of the native flora; so that
  now English broom gorse and brambles, willows and poplars, and some
  common American, Cape, and Australian weeds, alone meet the eye of the
  ordinary visitor. These, in Sir Joseph Hooker's opinion, render it
  absolutely impossible to restore the native flora, which only lingers in
  a few of the loftiest ridges and most inaccessible precipices, and is
  rarely seen except by some exploring naturalist.</p>

  <p>This almost total extirpation of a luxuriant and highly peculiar
  vegetation must inevitably have caused the destruction of a considerable
  portion of the lower animals which once existed on the island, and it is
  rather singular that so much as has actually been discovered should be
  left to show us the nature of the aboriginal fauna. Many naturalists have
  made small collections during short visits, but we owe our present
  complete knowledge of the two most interesting groups of animals, the
  insects, and the land-shells, mainly to the late Mr. T. Vernon Wollaston,
  who, after having thoroughly explored Madeira and the Canaries, undertook
  a voyage to St. Helena for the express purpose of studying its
  terrestrial fauna, and resided for six months (1875-76) in a high central
  position, whence the loftiest peaks could be explored. The results of his
  labours are contained in two volumes,<a name="NtA_121"
  href="#Nt_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a> which, like all that he wrote, are
  models of accuracy and research, and it is to these volumes that we are
  indebted for the interesting and suggestive facts which we here lay
  before our readers.</p>

<p><!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298"></a>{298}</span></p>

  <p><i>Insects&mdash;Coleoptera.</i>&mdash;The total number of species of
  beetles hitherto observed at St. Helena is 203, but of these no less than
  seventy-four are common and wide-spread insects, which have certainly, in
  Mr. Wollaston's opinion, been introduced by human agency. There remain
  129 which are believed to be truly aborigines, and of these all but one
  are found nowhere else on the globe. But in addition to this large amount
  of specific peculiarity (perhaps unequalled anywhere else in the world)
  the beetles of this island are equally remarkable for their generic
  isolation, and for the altogether exceptional proportion in which the
  great divisions of the order are represented. The species belong to
  thirty-nine genera, of which no less than twenty-five are peculiar to the
  island; and many of these are such isolated forms that it is impossible
  to find their allies in any particular country. Still more remarkable is
  the fact, that more than two-thirds of the whole number of indigenous
  species are Rhyncophora or weevils, while more than two-fifths
  (fifty-four species) belong to one family, the Cossonidæ. Now although
  the Rhyncophora are an immensely numerous group and always form a large
  portion of the insect population, they nowhere else approach such a
  proportion as this. For example, in Madeira they form one-sixth of the
  whole of the indigenous Coleoptera, in the Azores less than one-tenth,
  and in Britain one-seventh. Even more interesting is the fact that the
  twenty genera to which these insects belong are every one of them
  peculiar to the island, and in many cases have no near allies elsewhere,
  so that we cannot but look on this group of beetles as forming the most
  characteristic portion of the ancient insect fauna. Now, as the great
  majority of these are wood borers, and all are closely attached to
  vegetation and often to particular species of plants, we might, as Mr.
  Wollaston well observes, deduce the former luxuriant vegetation of the
  island from the great preponderance of this group, even had we not
  positive evidence that it was at no distant epoch densely forest-clad. We
  will now proceed briefly to indicate the numbers and peculiarities of
  each of the families of beetles which enter into the St. Helena fauna,
  taking them, not in <!-- Page 299 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page299"></a>{299}</span>systematic order, but according to their
  importance in the island.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">1. Rhyncophora.</span>&mdash;This great division
  includes the weevils and allied groups, and, as above stated, exceeds in
  number of species all the other beetles of the island. Four families are
  represented; the Cossonidæ, with fifteen peculiar genera comprising
  fifty-four species, and one minute insect (<i>Stenoscelis
  hylastoides</i>) forming a peculiar genus, but which has been found also
  at the Cape of Good Hope. It is therefore impossible to say of which
  country it is really a native, or whether it is indigenous to both, and
  dates back to the remote period when St. Helena received its early
  emigrants. All the Cossonidæ are found in the highest and wildest parts
  of the island where the native vegetation still lingers, and many of them
  are only found in the decaying stems of tree-ferns, box-wood, arborescent
  Compositæ, and other indigenous plants. They are all pre-eminently
  peculiar and isolated, having no direct affinity to species found in any
  other country. The next family, the Tanyrhynchidæ, has one peculiar genus
  in St. Helena, with ten species. This genus (Nesiotes) is remotely allied
  to European, Australian, and Madeiran insects of the same family: the
  habits of the species are similar to those of the Cossonidæ. The
  Trachyphl&oelig;idæ are represented by a single species belonging to a
  peculiar genus not very remote from a European form. The Anthribidæ again
  are highly peculiar. There are twenty-six species belonging to three
  genera, all endemic, and so extremely peculiar that they form two new
  subfamilies. One of the genera, Acarodes, is said to be allied to a
  Madeiran genus.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">2. Geodephaga.</span>&mdash;These are the terrestrial
  carnivorous beetles, very abundant in all parts of the world, especially
  in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. In St. Helena there
  are fourteen species belonging to three genera, one of which is peculiar.
  This is the <i>Haplothorax burchellii</i>, the largest beetle on the
  island, and now very rare. It resembles a large black Carabus. There is
  also a peculiar Calosoma, very distinct, though resembling in some
  respects certain African species. The rest of the <!-- Page 300 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page300"></a>{300}</span>Geodephaga, twelve in
  number, belong to the wide-spread genus Bembidium, but they are
  altogether peculiar and isolated, except one, which is of European type,
  and alone has wings, all the rest being wingless.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">3. Heteromera.</span>&mdash;This group is represented
  by three peculiar genera containing four species, with two species
  belonging to European genera. They belong to the families Opatridæ,
  Mordellidæ, and Anthicidæ.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">4. Brachyelytra.</span>&mdash;Of this group there are
  six peculiar species belonging to four European genera&mdash;Homalota,
  Philonthus, Xantholinus, and Oxytelus.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">5. Priocerata.</span>&mdash;The families Elateridæ
  and Anobiidæ are each represented by a peculiar species of a European
  genus.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">6. Phytophaga.</span>&mdash;There are only three
  species of this tribe, belonging to the European genus Longitarsus.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">7. Lamellicornis.</span>&mdash;Here are three species
  belonging to two genera. One is a peculiar species of Trox, allied to
  South African forms; the other two belong to the peculiar genus
  Melissius, which Mr. Wollaston considers to be remotely allied to
  Australian insects.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">8. Pseudo-trimera.</span>&mdash;Here we have the fine
  lady-bird <i>Chilomenus lunata</i>, also found in Africa, but apparently
  indigenous in St. Helena; and a peculiar species of Euxestes, a genus
  only found elsewhere in Madeira.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">9. Trichopterygidæ.</span>&mdash;These, the minutest
  of beetles, are represented by one species of the European and Madeiran
  genus Ptinella.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">10. Necrophaga.</span>&mdash;One indigenous species
  of Cryptophaga inhabits St. Helena, and this is said to be very closely
  allied to a Cape species.</p>

  <p><i>Peculiarities and Origin of the Coleoptera of St.
  Helena.</i>&mdash;We see that the great mass of the indigenous species
  are not only peculiar to the island, but so isolated in their characters
  as to show no close affinity with any existing insects; while a small
  number (about one-third of the whole) have some relations, though often
  very remote, with species now inhabiting Europe, Madeira, or South
  Africa. These facts clearly point to the very great antiquity of the
  insect fauna of St. Helena, which has allowed <!-- Page 301 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page301"></a>{301}</span>time for the
  modification of the originally introduced species, and their special
  adaptation to the conditions prevailing in this remote island. This
  antiquity is also shown by the remarkable specific modification of a few
  types. Thus the whole of the Cossonidæ may be referred to three types,
  one species only (<i>Hexacoptus ferrugineus</i>) being allied to the
  European Cossonidæ though forming a distinct genus; a group of three
  genera and seven species remotely allied to the <i>Stenoscelis
  hylastoides</i>, which occurs also at the Cape; while a group of twelve
  genera with forty-six species have their only (remote) allies in a few
  insects widely scattered in South Africa, New Zealand, Europe, and the
  Atlantic Islands. In like manner, eleven species of Bembidium form a
  group by themselves; and the Heteromera form two groups, one consisting
  of three genera and species of Opatridæ allied to a type found in
  Madeira, the other, Anthicodes, altogether peculiar.</p>

  <p>Now each of these types may well be descended from a single species
  which originally reached the island from some other land; and the great
  variety of generic and specific forms into which some of them have
  diverged is an indication, and to some extent a measure, of the
  remoteness of their origin. The rich insect fauna of Miocene age found in
  Switzerland consists mostly of genera which still inhabit Europe, with
  others which now inhabit the Cape of Good Hope or the tropics of Africa
  and South America; and it is not at all improbable that the origin of the
  St. Helena fauna dates back to at least as remote, and not improbably to
  a still earlier, epoch. But if so, many difficulties in accounting for
  its origin will disappear. We know that at that time many of the animals
  and plants of the tropics, of North America, and even of Australia,
  inhabited Europe; while during the changes of climate, which, as we have
  seen, there is good reason to believe periodically occurred, there would
  be much migration from the temperate zones towards the equator, and the
  reverse. If, therefore, the nearest ally of any insular group now
  inhabits a particular country, we are not obliged to suppose that it
  reached the island from that country, since we know that most groups have
  ranged in past times over <!-- Page 302 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page302"></a>{302}</span>wider areas than they now inhabit. Neither
  are we limited to the means of transmission across the ocean that now
  exist, because we know that those means have varied greatly. During such
  extreme changes of conditions as are implied by glacial periods and by
  warm polar climates, great alterations of winds and of ocean-currents are
  inevitable, and these are, as we have already proved, the two great
  agencies by which the transmission of living things to oceanic islands
  has been brought about. At the present time the south-east trade-winds
  blow almost constantly at St. Helena, and the ocean-currents flow in the
  same direction, so that any transmission of insects by their means must
  almost certainly be from South Africa. Now there is undoubtedly a South
  African element in the insect-fauna, but there is no less clearly a
  European, or at least a north-temperate element, and this is very
  difficult to account for by causes now in action. But when we consider
  that this northern element is chiefly represented by remote generic
  affinity, and has therefore all the signs of great antiquity, we find a
  possible means of accounting for it. We have seen that during early
  Tertiary times an almost tropical climate extended far into the northern
  hemisphere, and a temperate climate to the Arctic regions. But if at this
  time (as is not improbable) the Antarctic regions were as much ice-clad
  as they are now it is certain that an enormous change must have been
  produced in the winds. Instead of a great difference of temperature
  between each pole and the equator, the difference would be mainly between
  one hemisphere and the other, and this might so disturb the trade winds
  as to bring St. Helena within the south temperate region of
  storms&mdash;a position corresponding to that of the Azores and Madeira
  in the North Atlantic, and thus subject it to violent gales from all
  points of the compass. At this remote epoch the mountains of equatorial
  Africa may have been more extensive than they are now, and may have
  served as intermediate stations by which some northern insects may have
  migrated to the southern hemisphere.</p>

  <p>We must remember also that these peculiar forms are said to be
  northern only because their nearest allies are <!-- Page 303 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page303"></a>{303}</span>now found in the North
  Atlantic islands and Southern Europe; but it is not at all improbable
  that they are really widespread Miocene types, which have been preserved
  mainly in favourable insular stations. They may therefore have originally
  reached St. Helena from Southern Africa, or from some of the Atlantic
  islands, and may have been conveyed by oceanic currents as well as by
  winds.<a name="NtA_122" href="#Nt_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a> This is the
  more probable, as a large proportion of the St. Helena beetles live even
  in the perfect state within the stems of plants or trunks of trees, while
  the eggs and larvæ of a still larger number are likely to inhabit similar
  stations. Drift-wood might therefore be one of the most important
  agencies by which these insects reached the island.</p>

  <p>Let us now see how far the distribution of other groups support the
  conclusions derived from a consideration of the beetles. The Hemiptera
  have been studied by Dr. F. Buchanan White, and though far less known
  than the beetles, indicate somewhat similar relations. Eight out of
  twenty-one genera are peculiar, and the thirteen other genera are for the
  most part widely distributed, while one of the peculiar genera is of
  African type. The other orders of insects have not been collected or
  studied with <!-- Page 304 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page304"></a>{304}</span>sufficient care to make it worth while to
  refer to them in detail; but the land-shells have been carefully
  collected and minutely described by Mr. Wollaston himself, and it is
  interesting to see how far they agree with the insects in their
  peculiarities and affinities.</p>

  <p><i>Land-shells of St. Helena.</i>&mdash;The total number of species is
  only twenty-nine, of which seven are common in Europe or the other
  Atlantic islands, and are no doubt recent introductions. Two others,
  though described as distinct, are so closely allied to European forms,
  that Mr. Wollaston thinks they have probably been introduced and have
  become slightly modified by new conditions of life; so that there remain
  exactly twenty species which may be considered truly indigenous. No less
  than thirteen of these, however, appear to be extinct, being now only
  found on the surface of the ground or in the surface soil in places where
  the native forests have been destroyed and the land not cultivated. These
  twenty peculiar species belong to the following genera: Hyalina (3 sp.),
  Patula (4 sp.), Bulimus (7 sp.), Subulina (3 sp.), Succinea (3 sp.); of
  which, one species of Hyalina, three of Patula, all the Bulimi, and two
  of Subulina are extinct. The three Hyalinas are allied to European
  species, but all the rest appear to be highly peculiar, and to have no
  near allies with the species of any other country. Two of the Bulimi
  (<i>B. auris vulpinæ</i> and <i>B. darwinianus</i>) are said to somewhat
  resemble Brazilian, New Zealand, and Solomon Island forms, while neither
  Bulimus nor Succinea occur at all in the Madeira group.</p>

  <p>Omitting the species that have probably been introduced by human
  agency, we have here indications of a somewhat recent immigration of
  European types which may perhaps be referred to the glacial period; and a
  much more ancient immigration from unknown lands, which must certainly
  date back to Miocene, if not to Eocene, times.</p>

  <p><i>Absence of Fresh-water Organisms.</i>&mdash;A singular phenomenon
  is the total absence of indigenous aquatic forms of life in St. Helena.
  Not a single water-beetle or fresh-water shell has been discovered;
  neither do there seem to be any water-plants in the streams, except the
  common <!-- Page 305 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page305"></a>{305}</span>water-cress, one or two species of
  Cyperus, and the Australian <i>Isapis prolifera</i>. The same absence of
  fresh-water shells characterises the Azores, where, however, there is one
  indigenous water-beetle. In the Sandwich Islands also recent observations
  refer to the absence of water-beetles, though here there are a few
  fresh-water shells. It would appear therefore that the wide distribution
  of the same generic and specific forms which so generally characterises
  fresh-water organisms, and which has been so well illustrated by Mr.
  Darwin, has its limits in the <i>very remote</i> oceanic islands, owing
  to causes of which we are at present ignorant.</p>

  <p>The other classes of animals in St. Helena need occupy us little.
  There are no indigenous mammals, reptiles, fresh-water fishes or true
  land-birds; but there is one species of wader&mdash;a small plover
  (<i>Ægialitis sanctæ-helenæ</i>)&mdash;very closely allied to a species
  found in South Africa, but presenting certain differences which entitle
  it to the rank of a peculiar species. The plants, however, are of
  especial interest from a geographical point of view, and we must devote a
  few pages to their consideration as supplementing the scanty materials
  afforded by the animal life, thus enabling us better to understand the
  biological relations and probable history of the island.</p>

  <p><i>Native Vegetation of St. Helena.</i>&mdash;Plants have certainly
  more varied and more effectual means of passing over wide tracts of ocean
  than any kinds of animals. Their seeds are often so minute, of such small
  specific gravity, or so furnished with downy or winged appendages, as to
  be carried by the wind for enormous distances. The bristles or hooked
  spines of many small fruits cause them to become easily attached to the
  feathers of aquatic birds, and they may thus be conveyed for thousands of
  miles by these pre-eminent wanderers; while many seeds are so protected
  by hard outer coats and dense inner albumen, that months of exposure to
  salt water does not prevent them from germinating, as proved by the West
  Indian seeds that reach the Azores or even the west coast of Scotland,
  and, what is more to the point, by the fact stated by Mr. Melliss, that
  large seeds which have floated from <!-- Page 306 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page306"></a>{306}</span>Madagascar or Mauritius
  round the Cape of Good Hope, have been thrown on the shores of St. Helena
  and have then sometimes germinated!</p>

  <p>We have therefore little difficulty in understanding <i>how</i> the
  island was first stocked with vegetable forms. <i>When</i> it was so
  stocked (generally speaking), is equally clear. For as the peculiar
  coleopterous fauna, of which an important fragment remains, is mainly
  composed of species which are specially attached to certain groups of
  plants, we may be sure that the plants were there long before the insects
  could establish themselves. However ancient then is the insect fauna the
  flora must be more ancient still. It must also be remembered that plants,
  when once established in a suitable climate and soil, soon take
  possession of a country and occupy it almost to the complete exclusion of
  later immigrants. The fact of so many European weeds having overrun New
  Zealand and temperate North America may seem opposed to this statement,
  but it really is not so. For in both these cases the native vegetation
  has first been <span class="correction" title="Original reads `artifically'."
  >artificially</span> removed by man and the ground cultivated; and there
  is no reason to believe that any similar effect would be produced by the
  scattering of any amount of foreign seed on ground already completely
  clothed with an indigenous vegetation. We might therefore conclude <i>à
  priori</i>, that the flora of such an island as St. Helena would be of an
  excessively ancient type, preserving for us in a slightly modified form
  examples of the vegetation of the globe at the time when the island first
  rose above the ocean. Let us see then what botanists tell us of its
  character and affinities.</p>

  <p>The truly indigenous flowering plants are about fifty in number,
  besides twenty-six ferns. Forty of the former and ten of the latter are
  absolutely peculiar to the island, and, as Sir Joseph Hooker tells us,
  "with scarcely an exception, cannot be regarded as very close specific
  allies of any other plants at all. Seventeen of them belong to peculiar
  genera, and of the others, all differ so markedly as species from their
  congeners, that not one comes under the category of being an insular form
  of a continental species." The affinities of this flora are, Sir Joseph
  Hooker thinks, <!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page307"></a>{307}</span>mainly African and especially South
  African, as indicated by the presence of the genera Phylica, Pelargonium,
  Mesembryanthemum, Oteospermum, and Wahlenbergia, which are eminently
  characteristic of southern extra-tropical Africa. The sixteen ferns which
  are not peculiar are common either to Africa, India, or America, a wide
  range sufficiently explained by the dust-like spores of ferns, capable of
  being carried to unknown distances by the wind, and the great stability
  of their generic and specific forms, many of those found in the Miocene
  deposits of Switzerland, being hardly distinguishable from living
  species. This shows, that identity of <i>species</i> of ferns between St.
  Helena and distant countries does not necessarily imply a recent
  origin.</p>

  <p><i>The Relation of the St. Helena Compositæ.</i>&mdash;In an elaborate
  paper on the Compositæ,<a name="NtA_123"
  href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> Mr. Bentham gives us some valuable
  remarks on the affinities of the seven endemic species belonging to the
  genera Commidendron, Melanodendron, Petrobium, and Pisiadia, which forms
  so important a portion of the existing flora of St. Helena. He says:
  "Although nearer to Africa than to any other continent, those composite
  denizens which bear evidence of the greatest antiquity have their
  affinities for the most part in South America, while the colonists of a
  more recent character are South African." ... "Commidendron and
  Melanodendron are among the woody Asteroid forms exemplified in the
  Andine Diplostephium, and in the Australian Olearia. Petrobium is one of
  three genera, remains of a group probably of great antiquity, of which
  the two others are Podanthus in Chile and Astemma in the Andes. The
  Pisiadia is an endemic species of a genus otherwise Mascarene or of
  Eastern Africa, presenting a geographical connection analogous to that of
  the St. Helena Melhaniæ,<a name="NtA_124"
  href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> with the Mascarene Trochetia."</p>

  <p>Whenever such remote and singular cases of geographical affinity as
  the above are pointed out, the first <!-- Page 308 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page308"></a>{308}</span>impression is to
  imagine some mode by which a communication between the distant countries
  implicated might be effected; and this way of viewing the problem is
  almost universally adopted, even by naturalists. But if the principles
  laid down in this work and in my <i>Geographical Distribution of
  Animals</i> are sound, such a course is very unphilosophical. For, on the
  theory of evolution, nothing can be more certain than that groups now
  broken up and detached were once continuous, and that fragmentary groups
  and isolated forms are but the relics of once widespread types, which
  have been preserved in a few localities where the physical conditions
  were especially favourable, or where organic competition was less severe.
  The true explanation of all such remote geographical affinities is, that
  they date back to a time when the ancestral group of which they are the
  common descendants had a wider or a different distribution; and they no
  more imply any closer connection between the distant countries the allied
  forms now inhabit, than does the existence of living Equidæ in South
  Africa and extinct Equidæ in the Pliocene deposits of the Pampas, imply a
  continent bridging the South Atlantic to allow of their easy
  communication.</p>

  <p><i>Concluding Remarks on St. Helena.</i>&mdash;The sketch we have now
  given of the chief members of the indigenous fauna and flora of St.
  Helena shows, that by means of the knowledge we have obtained of past
  changes in the physical history of the earth, and of the various modes by
  which organisms are conveyed across the ocean, all the more important
  facts become readily intelligible. We have here an island of small size
  and great antiquity, very distant from every other land, and probably at
  no time very much less distant from surrounding continents, which became
  stocked by chance immigrants from other countries at some remote epoch,
  and which has preserved many of their more or less modified descendants
  to the present time. When first visited by civilised man it was in all
  probability far more richly stocked with plants and animals, forming a
  kind of natural museum or vivarium in which ancient types, perhaps dating
  back to the Miocene <!-- Page 309 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page309"></a>{309}</span>period, or even earlier, had been saved
  from the destruction which has overtaken their allies on the great
  continents. Unfortunately many, we do not know how many, of these forms
  have been exterminated by the carelessness and improvidence of its
  civilised but ignorant rulers; and it is only by the extreme ruggedness
  and inaccessibility of its peaks and crater-ridges that the scanty
  fragments have escaped by which alone we are able to obtain a glimpse of
  this interesting chapter in the life-history of our earth.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Sandwich Islands are an extensive group of large islands situated
  in the centre of the North Pacific, being 2,350 miles from the nearest
  part of the American coast&mdash;the bay of San Francisco, and about the
  same distance from the Marquesas and the Samoa Islands to the south, and
  the Aleutian Islands a little west of north. They are, therefore,
  wonderfully isolated in mid-ocean, and are only connected with the other
  Pacific Islands by widely scattered coral reefs and atolls, the nearest
  of which, however, are six or seven hundred miles distant, and are all
  nearly destitute of animal or vegetable life. The group consists of seven
  large inhabited islands besides four rocky islets; the largest, Hawaii,
  being seventy miles across and having an area 3,800 square
  miles&mdash;being somewhat larger than all the other islands together. A
  better conception of this large island will be formed by comparing it
  with Devonshire, with which it closely agrees both in size and shape,
  though its enormous volcanic mountains rise to nearly 14,000 feet high.
  <!-- Page 311 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page311"></a>{311}</span>Three of the smaller islands are each
  about the size of Hertfordshire or Bedfordshire, and the whole group
  stretches from north-west to south-east for a distance of about 350
  miles. Though so extensive, the entire archipelago is volcanic, and the
  largest island is rendered sterile and comparatively uninhabitable by its
  three active volcanoes and their widespread deposits of lava.</p>

</table>

  <p>The ocean depths by which these islands are separated from the nearest
  continents are enormous. North, east, and south, soundings have been
  obtained a little over or under three thousand fathoms, and these
  profound deeps extend over a large part of the North Pacific. We may <!--
  Page 312 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page312"></a>{312}</span>be
  quite sure, therefore, that the Sandwich Islands have, during their whole
  existence, been as completely severed from the great continents as they
  are now; but on the west and south there is a possibility of more
  extensive islands having existed, serving as stepping-stones to the
  island groups of the Mid-Pacific. This is indicated by a few
  widely-scattered coral islets, around which extend <!-- Page 313 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page313"></a>{313}</span>considerable areas of
  less depth, varying from two hundred to a thousand fathoms, and which
  <i>may</i> therefore indicate the sites of submerged islands of
  considerable extent. When we consider that east of New Zealand and New
  Caledonia, all the larger and loftier islands are of volcanic origin,
  with no trace of any ancient stratified rocks (except, perhaps, in the
  Marquesas, where, according to Jules Marcou, granite and gneiss are said
  to occur) it seems probable that the innumerable coral-reefs and atolls,
  which occur in groups on deeply submerged banks, mark the sites of bygone
  volcanic islands, similar to those which now exist, but which, after
  becoming extinct, have been lowered or destroyed by denudation, and
  finally have altogether disappeared except where their sites are
  indicated by the upward-growing coral-reefs. If this view is correct we
  should give up all idea of there ever having been a Pacific continent,
  but should look upon that vast ocean as having from the remotest
  geological epochs been the seat of volcanic forces, which from its
  profound depths have gradually built up the islands which now dot its
  surface, as well as many others which have sunk beneath its waves. The
  number of islands, as well as the total quantity of land-surface, may
  sometimes have been greater than it is now, and may thus have facilitated
  the transfer of organisms from one group to another, and more rarely even
  from the American, Asiatic, or Australian continents. Keeping these
  various facts and considerations in view, we may now proceed to examine
  the fauna and flora of the Sandwich Islands, and discuss the special
  phenomena they present.</p>

  <p><i>Zoology of the Sandwich Islands: Birds.</i>&mdash;It need hardly be
  said that indigenous mammalia are quite unknown in the Sandwich Islands,
  the most interesting of the higher animals being the birds, which are
  tolerably numerous and highly peculiar. Many aquatic and wading birds
  which range over the whole Pacific visit these islands, twenty-five
  species having been observed, but even of these six are peculiar&mdash;a
  coot, <i>Fulica alai</i>; a moorhen, <i>Gallinula galeata</i> var
  <i>sandvichensis</i>; a rail with rudimentary wings, <i>Pennula
  millei</i>; a stilt-plover, <i>Himantopus knudseni</i>; and <!-- Page 314
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page314"></a>{314}</span>two ducks,
  <i>Anas Wyvilliana</i> and <i>Bernicla sandvichensis</i>. The birds of
  prey are also great wanderers. Four have been found in the
  islands&mdash;the short-eared owl, <i>Otus brachyotus</i>, which ranges
  over the greater part of the globe, but is here said to resemble the
  variety found in Chile and the Galapagos; the barn owl, <i>Strix
  flammea</i>, of a variety common in the Pacific; a peculiar sparrow-hawk,
  <i>Accipiter hawaii</i>; and <i>Buteo solitarius</i>, a buzzard of a
  peculiar species, and coloured so as to resemble a hawk of the American
  subfamily Polyborinæ. It is to be noted that the genus Buteo abounds in
  America, but is not found in the Pacific; and this fact, combined with
  the remarkable colouration, renders it almost certain that this peculiar
  species is of American origin.</p>

  <p>The Passeres, or true perching birds, are especially interesting,
  being all of peculiar species, and, all but one, belonging to peculiar
  genera. Their numbers have been greatly increased since the first edition
  of this work appeared, partly by the exertions of American naturalists,
  and very largely by the researches of Mr. Scott B. Wilson, who visited
  the Sandwich Islands for the purpose of investigating their ornithology,
  and collected assiduously in the various islands of the group for a year
  and a half. This gentleman is now publishing a finely illustrated work on
  Hawaiian birds, and he has kindly furnished me with the following

  <p>Many of the birds recently described are representative forms found in
  the several islands of the group.</p>

  <p>Taking the above in the order here given, we have, first, two peculiar
  genera of true flycatchers, a family confined to the Old World, but
  extending over the Pacific as far as the Marquesas Islands. Next we have
  two peculiar genera (with four species) of honeysuckers, a family
  confined to the Australian region, and also ranging over all the Pacific
  Islands to the Marquesas. We now come to the most important group of
  birds in the Sandwich Islands, comprising seven or eight peculiar genera,
  and twenty-two species which are believed to form a peculiar family
  allied to the Oriental flower-peckers (Diceidæ), and perhaps remotely to
  the American greenlets (Vireonidæ), or <!-- Page 316 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page316"></a>{316}</span>tanagers (Tanagridæ).
  They possess singularly varied beaks, some having this organ much
  thickened like those of finches, to which family some of them have been
  supposed to belong. In any case they form a most peculiar group, and
  cannot be associated with any other known birds. The last species, and
  the only one not belonging to a peculiar genus, is the Hawaiian crow,
  belonging to the almost universally distributed genus Corvus.</p>

  <p>On the whole, the affinities of these birds are, as might be expected,
  chiefly with Australia and the Pacific Islands; but they exhibit in the
  buzzard, one of the owls, and perhaps in some of the Drepanididæ, slight
  indications of very rare or very remote communication with America. The
  amount of speciality is, however, wonderful, far exceeding that of any
  other islands; the only approach to it being made by New Zealand and
  Madagascar, which have a much more varied bird fauna and a smaller
  <i>proportionate</i> number of peculiar genera. The Galapagos, among the
  true oceanic islands, while presenting many peculiarities have only four
  out of the ten genera of Passeres peculiar. These facts undoubtedly
  indicate an immense antiquity for this group of islands, or the vicinity
  of some very ancient land (now submerged), from which some portion of
  their peculiar fauna might be derived. For further details as to the
  affinities and geographical distribution of the genera and species, the
  reader must consult Mr. Scott Wilson's work <i>The Birds of the Sandwich
  Islands</i>, already alluded to.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;The only other vertebrate animals are two
  lizards. One of these is a very widespread species, <i>Ablepharus
  p&oelig;cilopleurus</i>, ranging from the Pacific Islands to West Africa.
  The other is said to form a peculiar genus of geckoes, but both its
  locality and affinities appear to be somewhat doubtful.</p>

  <p><i>Land-shells.</i>&mdash;The only other group of animals which has
  been carefully studied, and which presents features of especial interest,
  are the land-shells. These are very numerous, about thirty genera, and
  between three and four hundred species having been described; and it is
  remarkable that this single group contains as many species of <!-- Page
  317 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  Islands from the Pelew Islands and Samoa to the Marquesas. All the
  species are peculiar, and about three-fourths of the whole belong to
  peculiar genera, fourteen of which constitute the subfamily
  Achatinellinæ, entirely confined to this group of islands and
  constituting its most distinguishing feature. Thirteen genera (comprising
  sixty-four species) are found also in the other Polynesian Islands, but
  three genera of Auriculidæ (Plecotrema, Pedipes, and Blauneria) are not
  found in the Pacific, but inhabit&mdash;the former genus Australia,
  China, Bourbon, and Cuba, the two latter the West Indian Islands. Another
  remarkable peculiarity of these islands is the small number of
  Operculata, which are represented by only one genus and five species,
  while the other Pacific Islands have twenty genera and 115 species, or
  more than half the number of the Inoperculata. This difference is so
  remarkable that it is worth stating in a comparative form:&mdash;</p>

  <p>When we remember that in the West Indian Islands the Operculata abound
  in a greater proportion than even in the Pacific Islands generally, we
  are led to the conclusion that limestone, which is plentiful in both
  these areas, is especially favourable to them, while the purely volcanic
  rocks are especially unfavourable. The other peculiarities of the
  Sandwich Islands, however, such as the enormous preponderance of the
  strictly endemic Achatinellinæ, and the presence of genera which occur
  elsewhere only beyond the Pacific area in various parts of the great
  continents, undoubtedly point to a very remote origin, at a time when the
  distribution of many of the groups of mollusca was very different from
  that which now prevails.</p>

  <p>A very interesting feature of the Sandwich group is the extent to
  which the species and even the genera are confined to separate islands.
  Thus the genera Carelia and Catinella with eight species are peculiar to
  the island of Kaui; Bulimella, Apex, Frickella, and Blauneria, to Oahu;
  Perdicella to Maui; and Eburnella to Lanai. <!-- Page 318 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page318"></a>{318}</span>The Rev. John T.
  Gulick, who has made a special study of the Achatinellinæ, informs us
  that the average range of the species in this sub-family is five or six
  miles, while some are restricted to but one or two square miles, and only
  very few have the range of a whole island. Each valley, and often each
  side of a valley, and sometimes even every ridge and peak possesses its
  peculiar species.<a name="NtA_125" href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a>
  The island of Oahu, in which the capital is situated, has furnished about
  half the species already known. This is partly due to its being more
  forest-clad, but also, no doubt, in part to its being better explored, so
  that notwithstanding the exceptional riches of the group, we have no
  reason to suppose that there are not many more species to be found in the
  less explored islands. Mr. Gulick tells us that the forest region that
  covers one of the mountain ranges of Oahu is about forty miles in length,
  and five or six miles in width, yet this small territory furnishes about
  175 species of Achatinellidæ, represented by 700 or 800 varieties. The
  most important peculiar genus, not belonging to the Achatinella group, is
  Carelia, with six species and several named varieties, all peculiar to
  Kaui, the most westerly of the large islands. This would seem to show
  that the small islets stretching westward, and situated on an extensive
  bank with less than a thousand fathoms of water over it, may indicate the
  position of a large submerged island whence some portion of the Sandwich
  Island fauna was derived.</p>

  <p><i>Insects.</i>&mdash;Owing to the researches of the Rev. T. Blackburn
  we have now a fair knowledge of the Coleopterous fauna of these islands.
  Unfortunately some of the most productive islands in plants&mdash;Kaui
  and Maui&mdash;were very little explored, but during a residence of six
  years the equally rich Oahu was well worked, and the general character of
  the beetle fauna must therefore be considered to be pretty accurately
  determined. Out of 428 species collected, many being obviously recent
  introductions, no <!-- Page 319 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page319"></a>{319}</span>less than 352 species and 99 of the genera
  appear to be quite peculiar to the archipelago. Sixty of these species
  are Carabidæ, forty-two are Staphylinidæ, forty are Nitidulidæ, twenty
  are Ptinidæ, twenty are Ciodidæ, thirty are Aglycyderidæ, forty-five are
  Curculionidæ, and fourteen are Cerambycidæ, the remainder being
  distributed among twenty-two other families. Many important families,
  such as Cicindelidæ, Scarab&oelig;idæ, Buprestidæ, and the whole of the
  enormous series of the Phytophaga are either entirely absent or are only
  represented by a few introduced species. In the eight families enumerated
  above most of the species belong to peculiar genera which usually contain
  numerous distinct species; and we may therefore consider these to
  represent the descendants of the most ancient immigrants into the
  islands.</p>

  <p>Two important characteristics of the Coleopterous fauna are, the small
  size of the species, and the great scarcity of individuals. Dr. Sharp,
  who has described many of them,<a name="NtA_126"
  href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> says they are "mostly small or very
  minute insects," and that "there are few&mdash;probably it would be
  correct to say absolutely none&mdash;that would strike an ordinary
  observer as being beautiful." Mr. Blackburn says that it was not an
  uncommon thing for him to pass a morning on the mountains and to return
  home with perhaps two or three specimens, having seen literally nothing
  else except the few species that are generally abundant. He states that
  he "has frequently spent an hour sweeping flower-covered herbage, or
  beating branches of trees over an inverted white umbrella without seeing
  the sign of a beetle of any kind." To those who have collected in any
  tropical or even temperate country on or near a continent, this poverty
  of insect life must seem almost incredible; and it affords us a striking
  proof of how erroneous are those now almost obsolete views which imputed
  the abundance, variety, size, and colour of insects to the warmth and
  sunlight and luxuriant vegetation of the tropics. The facts become quite
  intelligible, however, if we consider that only <!-- Page 320 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page320"></a>{320}</span>minute insects of
  certain groups could ever reach the islands by natural means, and that
  these, already highly specialised for certain defined modes of life,
  could only develop slowly into slightly modified forms of the original
  types. Some of the groups, however, are considered by Dr. Sharp to be
  very ancient generalised forms, especially the peculiar family
  Aglycyderidæ, which he looks upon as being "absolutely the most primitive
  of all the known forms of Coleoptera, it being a synthetic form linking
  the isolated Rhynchophagous series of families with the Clavicorn series.
  About thirty species are known in the Hawaiian Islands, and they exhibit
  much difference <i>inter se</i>." A few remarks on each of the more
  important of the families will serve to indicate their probable mode and
  period of introduction into the islands.</p>

  <p>The Carabidæ consist chiefly of seven peculiar genera of Anchomenini
  comprising fifty-one species, and several endemic species of Bembidiinæ.
  They are highly peculiar and are all of small size, and may have
  originally reached the islands in the crevices of the drift wood from
  N.W. America which is still thrown on their shores, or, more rarely, by
  means of a similar drift from the N.-Western islands of the Pacific.<a
  name="NtA_127" href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> It is interesting to
  note that peculiar species of the same groups of Carabidæ are found in
  the Azores, Canaries, and St. Helena, indicating that they possess some
  special facilities for transmission across wide oceans and for
  establishing themselves upon oceanic islands. The Staphylinidæ present
  many peculiar species of known genera. Being still more minute and
  usually more ubiquitous than the Carabidæ, there is no difficulty in
  accounting for their presence in the islands by the same means of
  dispersal. The Nitidulidæ, Ptinidæ, and Ciodidæ being very small and of
  varied habits, either the perfect insects, their eggs or larvæ, may have
  been introduced either by water or wind carriage, or through the agency
  of birds. The Curculionidæ, being wood bark or nut borers, would have
  considerable facilities for transmission by floating timber, fruits, or
  nuts; and the eggs or larvæ of the <!-- Page 321 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page321"></a>{321}</span>peculiar Cerambycidæ
  must have been introduced by the same means. The absence of so many
  important and cosmopolitan groups whose size or constitution render them
  incapable of being thus transmitted over the sea, as well as of many
  which seem equally well adapted as those which are found in the islands,
  indicate how rare have been the conditions for successful immigration;
  and this is still further emphasized by the extreme specialisation of the
  fauna, indicating that there has been no repeated immigration of the same
  species which would tend, as in the case of Bermuda, to preserve the
  originally introduced forms unchanged by the effects of repeated
  intercrossing.</p>

  <p><i>Vegetation of the Sandwich Islands.</i>&mdash;The flora of these
  islands is in many respects so peculiar and remarkable, and so well
  supplements the information derived from its interesting but scanty
  fauna, that a brief account of its more striking features will not be out
  of place; and we fortunately have a pretty full knowledge of it, owing to
  the researches of the German botanist Dr. W. Hildebrand.<a name="NtA_128"
  href="#Nt_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Considering their extreme isolation, their uniform volcanic soil, and
  the large proportion of the chief island which consists of barren
  lava-fields, the flora of the Sandwich Islands is extremely rich,
  consisting, so far as at present known, of 844 species of flowering
  plants and 155 ferns. This is considerably richer than the Azores (439
  Phanerogams and 39 ferns), which though less extensive are perhaps better
  known, or than the Galapagos (332 Phanerogams), which are more strictly
  comparable, being equally volcanic, while their somewhat smaller area may
  perhaps be compensated by their proximity to the American continent. Even
  New Zealand with more than twenty times the area of the Sandwich group,
  whose soil and climate are much more varied and whose botany has been
  thoroughly explored, has not a very much larger number of flowering
  plants (935 species), while in ferns it is barely equal.</p>

  <p><i>Peculiar Features of the Flora.</i>&mdash;This rich insular flora
  is wonderfully peculiar, for if we deduct 115 species, which are believed
  to have been introduced by man, there remain 705 species of flowering
  plants of which 574, or more than four-fifths, are quite peculiar to the
  islands. There are no less than 38 peculiar genera out of a total of 265
  and these 38 genera comprise 254 species, so that the most isolated forms
  are those which most abound and thus give a special character to the
  flora. Besides these peculiar types, several genera of wide range are
  here represented by highly peculiar species. Such are the Hawaiian
  species of Lobelia which are woody shrubs either creeping or six feet
  high, while a species of one of the peculiar genera of Lobeliaceæ is a
  tree reaching a height of forty feet. Shrubby geraniums grow twelve or
  fifteen feet high, and some vacciniums grow as epiphytes on the trunks of
  trees. Violets and plantains also form tall shrubby plants, and there are
  many strange arborescent compositæ, as in other oceanic islands.</p>

  <p>The affinities of the flora generally are very wide. Although there
  are many Polynesian groups, yet Australian, New Zealand, and American
  forms are equally represented. Dr. Pickering notes the total absence of a
  large number of families found in Southern Polynesia, such as
  Dilleniceæa, Anonaceæ, Olacaceæ, Aurantiaceæ, Guttiferæ, Malpighiaceæ,
  Meliaceæ, Combretaceæ, Rhizophoraceæ, Melastomaceæ, Passifloraceæ,
  Cunoniaceæ, Jasminaceæ, Acanthaceæ, Myristicaceæ, and Casuaraceæ, as well
  as the genera Clerodendron, Ficus, and epidendric orchids. Australian
  affinities are shown by the genera Exocarpus, Cyathodes, Melicope,
  Pittosporum, and by a phyllodinous Acacia. New Zealand is represented by
  Ascarina, Coprosma, Acæna, and several Cyperaceæ; while America is
  represented by the genera Nama, Gunnera, Phyllostegia, Sisyrinchium, and
  by a red-flowered Rubus and a yellow-flowered Sanicula allied to Oregon
  species.</p>

  <p>There is no true alpine flora on the higher summits, but several of
  the temperate forms extend to a great elevation. Thus Mr. Pickering
  records Vaccinium, Ranunculus, Silene, Gnaphalium and Geranium, as
  occurring above ten <!-- Page 324 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page324"></a>{324}</span>thousand feet elevation; while Viola,
  Drosera, Acæna, Lobelia, Edwardsia, Dodonæa, Lycopodium, and many
  Compositæ, range above six thousand feet. Vaccinium and Silene are very
  interesting, as they are almost peculiar to the North Temperate zone;
  while many plants allied to Antarctic species are found in the bogs of
  the high plateaux.</p>

  <p>The proportionate abundance of the different families in this
  interesting flora is as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Nine other orders, Geraniaceæ, Rhamnaceæ, Rosaceæ, Myrtaceæ,
  Primulaceæ, Loganiaceæ, Liliaceæ, Thymelaceæ, and Cucurbitaceæ, have six
  or seven species each; and among the more important orders which have
  less than five species each are Ranunculaceæ, Cruciferæ, Vaccinacæ,
  Apocynaceæ, Boraginaceæ, Scrophulariaceæ, Polygonaceæ, Orchidaceæ, and
  Juncaceæ. The most remarkable feature here is the great abundance of
  Lobeliaceæ, a character of the flora which is probably unique; while the
  superiority of Labiatæ to Leguminosæ and the scarcity of Rosaceæ and
  Orchidaceæ are also very unusual. Composites, as in most temperate
  floras, stand at the head of the list, and it will be interesting to note
  the affinities which they indicate. Omitting eleven species which are
  cosmopolitan, and have no doubt entered with civilised man, there remain
  nineteen genera and seventy species of Compositæ in the islands.
  Sixty-one of the species are peculiar, as are eight of the genera; while
  the genus Lipochæta with eleven species is only known elsewhere in the
  Galapagos, where a single species occurs. We may therefore consider that
  nine out of the nineteen genera of Hawaiian <!-- Page 325 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page325"></a>{325}</span>Compositæ are really
  confined to the Archipelago. The relations of the peculiar genera and
  species are indicated in the following table.<a name="NtA_129"

  <p>The great preponderance of American relations in the Compositæ, as
  above indicated, is very interesting and suggestive, since the Compositæ
  of Tahiti and the other Pacific Islands are allied to Malaysian types. It
  is here that we meet with some of the most isolated and remarkable forms,
  implying great antiquity; and when we consider the enormous extent and
  world-wide distribution of this order (comprising about ten thousand
  species), its distinctness from all others, the great specialisation of
  its flowers to attract insects, and of its seeds for dispersal by wind
  and other means, we can hardly doubt that its origin dates back to a very
  remote epoch. We may therefore look upon the Compositæ as representing
  the most ancient portion of the existing flora of the Sandwich Islands,
  carrying us back to a very remote period when the facilities for
  communication with America were greater than they are now. This may be
  indicated by the two deep submarine banks in the North Pacific, between
  the Sandwich Islands and San Francisco, which, from an ocean floor <!--
  Page 326 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page326"></a>{326}</span>nearly 3,000 fathoms deep, rise up to
  within a few hundred fathoms of the surface, and seem to indicate the
  subsidence of two islands, each about as large as Hawaii. The plants of
  North Temperate affinity may be nearly as old, but these may have been
  derived from Northern Asia by way of Japan and the extensive line of
  shoals which run north-westward from the Sandwich Islands, as shown on
  our map. Those which exhibit Polynesian or Australian affinities,
  consisting for the most part of less highly modified species, usually of
  the same genera, may have had their origin at a later, though still
  somewhat remote period, when large islands, indicated by the extensive
  shoals to the south and south-west, offered facilities for the
  transmission of plants from the tropical portions of the Pacific
  Ocean.</p>

  <p>It is in the smaller and most woody islands in the westerly portion of
  the group, especially in Kauai and Oahu, that the greatest number and
  variety of plants are found and the largest proportion of peculiar
  species and genera. These are believed to form the oldest portion of the
  group, the volcanic activity having ceased and allowed a luxuriant
  vegetation more completely to cover the islands, while in the larger and
  much newer islands of Hawaii and Maui the surface is more barren and the
  vegetation comparatively monotonous. Thus while twelve of the arborescent
  Lobeliaceæ have been found on Hawaii no less than seventeen occur on the
  much smaller Oahu, which has even a genus of these plants confined to
  it.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that while the non-peculiar genera of
  flowering plants have little more than two species to a genus, the
  endemic genera average six and three-quarter species to a genus. These
  may be considered to represent the earliest immigrants which became
  firmly established in the comparatively unoccupied islands, and have
  gradually become modified into such complete harmony with their new
  conditions that they have developed into many diverging forms adapting
  them to different <i>habitats</i>. The following is a list of the
  peculiar genera with the number of species in each. <!-- Page 327

  <p>The great preponderance of the two orders Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ are
  what first strike us in this list. In the former case the facilities for
  wind-dispersal afforded by the structure of so many of the seeds render
  it comparatively easy to account for their having reached the islands at
  an early period. The Lobelias, judging from Hildebrand's descriptions,
  may have been transported in several <!-- Page 328 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page328"></a>{328}</span>different ways. Most of
  the endemic genera are berry-bearers and thus offer the means of
  dispersal by fruit-eating birds. The endemic species of the genus Lobelia
  have sometimes very minute seeds, which might be carried long distances
  by wind, while other species, especially Lobelia gaudichaudii, have a
  "hard, almost woody capsule which opens late," apparently well adapted
  for floating long distances. Afterwards "the calycine covering withers
  away, leaving a fenestrate woody network" enclosing the capsule, and the
  seeds themselves are "compressed, reniform, or orbicular, and margined,"
  and thus of a form well adapted to be carried to great heights and
  distances by gales or hurricanes.</p>

  <p>In the other orders which present several endemic genera indications
  of the mode of transit to the islands are afforded us. The Araliaceæ are
  said to have fleshy fruits or drupes more or less succulent. The Rubiaceæ
  have usually berries or drupes, while one genus, Kadua, has "small, flat,
  winged seeds." The two largest genera of the Labiatæ are said to have
  "fleshy nucules," which would no doubt be swallowed by birds.<a
  name="NtA_130" href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Antiquity of the Hawaiian Fauna and Flora.</i>&mdash;The great
  antiquity implied by the peculiarities of the fauna and flora, no less
  than by the geographical conditions and surroundings, of this group, will
  enable us to account for another peculiarity of its flora&mdash;the
  absence of so many families found in other Pacific Islands. For the
  earliest immigrants would soon occupy much of the surface, and become
  specially modified in accordance with the conditions of the locality, and
  these would serve as a barrier against the intrusion of many forms which
  at a later <!-- Page 329 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page329"></a>{329}</span>period spread over Polynesia. The extreme
  remoteness of the islands, and the probability that they have always been
  more isolated than those of the Central Pacific, would also necessarily
  result in an imperfect and fragmentary representation of the flora of
  surrounding lands.</p>

  <p><i>Concluding Observations on the Fauna and Flora of the Sandwich
  Islands.</i>&mdash;The indications thus afforded by a study of the flora
  seem to accord well with what we know of the fauna of the islands. Plants
  having so much greater facilities for dispersal than animals, and also
  having greater specific longevity and greater powers of endurance under
  adverse conditions, exhibit in a considerable degree the influence of the
  primitive state of the islands and their surroundings; while members of
  the animal world, passing across the sea with greater difficulty and
  subject to extermination by a variety of adverse conditions, retain much
  more of the impress of a recent state of things, with perhaps here and
  there an indication of that ancient approach to America so clearly shown
  in the Compositæ and some other portions of the flora.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">General Remarks on Oceanic Islands.</span></p>

  <p>We have now reviewed the main features presented by the assemblages of
  organic forms which characterise the more important and best known of the
  Oceanic Islands. They all agree in the total absence of indigenous
  mammalia and amphibia, while their reptiles, when they possess any, do
  not exhibit indications of extreme isolation and antiquity. Their birds
  and insects present just that amount of specialisation and diversity from
  continental forms which may be well explained by the known means of
  dispersal acting through long periods; their land shells indicate greater
  isolation, owing to their admittedly less effective means of conveyance
  across the ocean; while their plants show most clearly the effects of
  those changes of conditions which we have reason to believe have occurred
  during the Tertiary epoch, and preserve to us in highly specialised and
  archaic forms some record of the primeval immigration by which the
  islands were originally <!-- Page 330 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page330"></a>{330}</span>clothed with vegetation. But in every case
  the series of forms of life in these islands is scanty and imperfect as
  compared with far less favourable continental areas, and no one of them
  presents such an assemblage of animals or plants as we always find in an
  island which we know has once formed part of a continent.</p>

  <p>It is still more important to note that none of these oceanic
  archipelagoes present us with a single type which we may suppose to have
  been preserved from Mesozoic times; and this fact, taken in connection
  with the volcanic or coralline origin of all of them, powerfully enforces
  the conclusion at which we have arrived in the earlier portion of this
  volume, that during the whole period of geologic time as indicated by the
  fossiliferous rocks, our continents and oceans have, speaking broadly,
  been permanent features of our earth's surface. For had it been
  otherwise&mdash;had sea and land changed place repeatedly as was once
  supposed&mdash;had our deepest oceans been the seat of great continents
  while the site of our present continents was occupied by an oceanic
  abyss&mdash;is it possible to imagine that no fragments of such
  continents would remain in the present oceans, bringing down to us some
  of their ancient forms of life preserved with but little change? The
  correlative facts, that the islands of our great oceans are all volcanic
  (or coralline built probably upon degraded volcanic islands or extinct
  submarine volcanoes), and that their productions are all more or less
  clearly related to the existing inhabitants of the nearest continents,
  are hardly consistent with any other theory than the permanence of our
  oceanic and continental areas.</p>

  <p>We may here refer to the one apparent exception, which, however, lends
  additional force to the argument. New Zealand is sometimes classed as an
  oceanic island, but it is not so really; and we shall discuss its
  peculiarities and probable origin further on.</p>

  <p>We now proceed to examine those islands which are the very reverse of
  the "oceanic" class, being fragments of continents or of larger islands
  from which they have been separated, by subsidence of the intervening
  land at a period which, geologically, must be considered recent. Such
  islands are always still connected with their parent land by a shallow
  sea, usually indeed not exceeding a hundred fathoms deep; they always
  possess mammalia and reptiles either wholly or in large proportion
  identical with those of the mainland; while their entire flora and fauna
  is characterised either by the total absence or comparative scarcity of
  those endemic or peculiar species and genera which are so striking a
  feature of almost all oceanic islands. Such islands will, of course,
  differ from each <!-- Page 332 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page332"></a>{332}</span>other in size, in antiquity, and in the
  richness of their respective faunas, as well as in their distance from
  the parent land and the facilities for intercommunication with it; and
  these diversities of conditions will manifest themselves in the greater
  or less amount of speciality of their animal productions.</p>

  <p>This speciality, when it exists, may have been brought about in two
  ways. A species or even a genus may on a continent have had a very
  limited area of distribution, and this area may be wholly or almost
  wholly contained in the separated portion or island, to which it will
  henceforth be peculiar. Even when the area occupied by a species is
  pretty equally divided at the time of separation between the island and
  the continent, it may happen that it will become extinct on the latter,
  while it may survive on the former, because the limited number of
  individuals after division may be unable to maintain themselves against
  the severer competition or more contrasted climate of the continent,
  while they may flourish, under the more favourable insular conditions. On
  the other hand, when a species continues to exist in both areas, it may
  on the island be subjected to some modifications by the altered
  conditions, and may thus come to present characters which differentiate
  it from its continental allies and constitute it a new species. We shall
  in the course of our survey meet with cases illustrative of both these
  processes.</p>

  <p>The best examples of recent continental islands are Great Britain and
  Ireland, Japan, Formosa, and the larger Malay Islands, especially Borneo,
  Java, and Celebes; and as each of these presents special features of
  interest, we will give a short outline of their zoology and past history
  in relation to that of the continents from which they have recently been
  separated, commencing with our own islands, to which the present chapter
  will be devoted.</p>

  <p><i>Recent Physical Changes in the British Isles.</i>&mdash;Great
  Britain is perhaps the most typical example of a large and recent
  continental island now to be found upon the globe. It is joined to the
  Continent by a shallow bank which extends from Denmark to the Bay of
  Biscay, the 100 fathom line from these extreme points receding from the
  <!-- Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page333"></a>{333}</span>coasts so as to include the whole of the
  British Isles and about fifty miles beyond them to the westward.
  (<i>See</i> Map.)</p>

<tr><td class="qspcsingle" style="text-align:left"> The narrow channel between Norway and Denmark is 2,580 feet deep.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Beyond this line the sea deepens rapidly to the 500 and 1,000 fathom
  lines, the distance between 100 and 1,000 <!-- Page 334 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page334"></a>{334}</span>fathoms being from
  twenty to fifty miles, except where there is a great outward curve to
  include the Porcupine Bank 170 miles west of Galway, and to the
  north-west of Caithness where a narrow ridge less than 500 fathoms below
  the surface joins the extensive bank under 300 fathoms, on which are
  situated the Faroe Islands and Iceland, and which stretches across to
  Greenland. In the North Channel between Ireland and Scotland, and in the
  Minch between the outer Hebrides and Skye, are a series of hollows in the
  sea-bottom from 100 to 150 fathoms deep. These correspond exactly to the
  points between the opposing highlands where the greatest accumulations of
  ice would necessarily occur during the glacial epoch, and they may well
  be termed submarine lakes, of exactly the same nature as those which
  occur in similar positions on land.</p>

  <p><i>Proofs of Former Elevation&mdash;Submerged Forests.</i>&mdash;What
  renders Britain particularly instructive as an example of a recent
  continental island is the amount of direct evidence that exists, of
  several distinct kinds, showing that the land has been sufficiently
  elevated (or the sea depressed) to unite it with the Continent,&mdash;and
  this at a very recent period. The first class of evidence is the
  existence, all round our coasts, of the remains of submarine forests
  often extending far below the present low-water mark. Such are the
  submerged forests near Torquay in Devonshire, and near Falmouth in
  Cornwall, both containing stumps of trees in their natural position
  rooted in the soil, with deposits of peat, branches, and nuts, and often
  with remains of insects and other land animals. These occur in very
  different conditions and situations, and some have been explained by
  changes in the height of the tide, or by pebble banks shutting out the
  tidal waters from estuaries; but there are numerous examples to which
  such hypotheses cannot apply, and which can only be explained by an
  actual subsidence of the land (or rise of the sea-level) since the trees
  grew.</p>

  <p>We cannot give a better idea of these forests than by quoting the
  following account by Mr. Pengelly of a visit to one which had been
  exposed by a violent storm on the coast of Devonshire, at Blackpool near
  Dartmouth:&mdash; <!-- Page 335 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page335"></a>{335}</span></p>

  <p>"We were so fortunate as to reach the beach at spring-tide low-water,
  and to find, admirably exposed, by far the finest example of a submerged
  forest which I have ever seen. It occupied a rectangular area, extending
  from the small river or stream at the western end of the inlet, about one
  furlong eastward; and from the low-water line thirty yards up the strand.
  The lower or seaward portion of the forest area, occupying about
  two-thirds of its entire breadth, consisted of a brownish drab-coloured
  clay, which was crowded with vegetable <i>débris</i>, such as small
  twigs, leaves, and nuts. There were also numerous prostrate trunks and
  branches of trees, lying partly imbedded in the clay, without anything
  like a prevalent direction. The trunks varied from six inches to upwards
  of two feet in diameter. Much of the wood was found to have a reddish or
  bright pink hue, when fresh surfaces were exposed. Some of it, as well as
  many of the twigs, had almost become a sort of ligneous pulp, while other
  examples were firm, and gave a sharp crackling sound on being broken.
  Several large stumps projected above the clay in a vertical direction,
  and sent roots and rootlets into the soil in all directions and to
  considerable distances. It was obvious that the movement by which the
  submergence was effected had been so uniform as not to destroy the
  approximate horizontality of the old forest ground. One fine example was
  noted of a large prostrate trunk having its roots still attached, some of
  them sticking up above the clay, while others were buried in it.
  Hazelnuts were extremely abundant&mdash;some entire, others broken, and
  some obviously gnawed.... It has been stated that the forest area reached
  the spring-tide low-water line; hence as the greatest tidal range on this
  coast amounts to eighteen feet, we are warranted in inferring that the
  subsidence amounted to eighteen feet as a minimum, even if we suppose
  that some of the trees grew in a soil the surface of which was not above
  the level of high water. There is satisfactory evidence that in Torbay it
  was not less than forty feet, and that in Falmouth Harbour it amounted to
  at least sixty-seven feet."<a name="NtA_131"
  href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 336 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page336"></a>{336}</span></p>

  <p>On the coast of the Bristol Channel similar deposits occur, as well as
  along much of the coast of Wales and in Holyhead Harbour. It is believed
  by geologists that the whole Bristol Channel was, at a comparatively
  recent period, an extensive plain, through which flowed the River Severn;
  for in addition to the evidence of submerged forests there are on the
  coast of Glamorganshire numerous caves and fissures in the face of high
  sea cliffs, in one of which no less than a thousand antlers of the
  reindeer were found, the remains of animals which had been devoured there
  by bears and hyænas; facts which can only be explained by the existence
  of some extent of dry land stretching seaward from the present cliffs,
  but since submerged and washed away. This plain may have continued down
  to very recent times, since the whole of the Bristol Channel to beyond
  Lundy Island is under twenty-five fathoms deep. In the east of England we
  have a similar forest-bed at Cromer in Norfolk; and in the north of
  Holland an old land surface has been found fifty-six feet below
  high-water mark.</p>

  <p><i>Buried River Channels.</i>&mdash;Still more remarkable are the
  buried river channels which have been traced on many parts of our coasts.
  In order to facilitate the study of the glacial deposits of Scotland, Dr.
  James Croll obtained the details of about 250 bores put down in all parts
  of the mining districts of Scotland for the purpose of discovering
  minerals.<a name="NtA_132" href="#Nt_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> These
  revealed the interesting fact that there are ancient valleys and river
  channels at depths of from 100 to 260 feet below the present sea-level.
  These old rivers sometimes run in quite different directions from the
  present lines of drainage, connecting what are now distinct valleys; and
  they are so completely filled up and hidden by boulder clay, drift, and
  sands, that there is no indication of their presence on the surface,
  which often consists of mounds or low hills more than 100 feet high. One
  of these old valleys connects the Clyde near Dumbarton with the Forth at
  Grangemouth, and appears to have contained two streams flowing in
  opposite directions from a watershed about midway at Kilsith. At <!--
  Page 337 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page337"></a>{337}</span>Grangemouth the old channel is 260 feet
  below the sea-level. The watershed at Kilsith is now 160 feet above the
  sea, the old valley bottom being 120 feet deep or forty feet above the
  sea. In some places the old valley was a ravine with precipitous rocky
  walls, which have been found in mining excavations. Sir A. Geikie, who
  has himself discovered many similar buried valleys, is of opinion that
  "they unquestionably belong to the period of the boulder clay."</p>

  <p>We have here a clear proof that, when these rivers were formed, the
  land must have stood in relation to the sea <i>at least</i> 260 feet
  higher than it does now, and probably much more; and this is sufficient
  to join England to the continent. Supporting this evidence, we have
  freshwater or littoral shells found at great depths off our coasts. Mr.
  Godwin Austen records the dredging up of a freshwater shell (<i>Unio
  pictorum</i>) off the mouth of the English Channel between the fifty
  fathom and 100 fathom lines, while in the same locality gravel banks with
  littoral shells now lie under sixty or seventy fathoms water.<a
  name="NtA_133" href="#Nt_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> More recently Mr. Gwyn
  Jeffreys has recorded the discovery of eight species of fossil arctic
  shells off the Shetland Isles in about ninety fathoms water, all being
  characteristic shallow water species, so that their association at this
  great depth is a distinct indication of considerable subsidence.<a
  name="NtA_134" href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Time of Last Union with the Continent.</i>&mdash;The period when
  this last union with the continent took place was comparatively recent,
  as shown by the identity of the shells with living species, and the fact
  that the buried river channels are all covered with clays and gravels of
  the glacial period, of such a character as to indicate that most of them
  were deposited above the sea-level. From these and various other
  indications geologists are all agreed that the last continental period,
  as it is called, was subsequent to the greatest development of the ice,
  but probably before the cold epoch had wholly passed away. But if so
  recent, we should naturally expect our land still <!-- Page 338 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page338"></a>{338}</span>to show an almost
  perfect community with the adjacent parts of the continent in its natural
  productions; and such is found to be the case. All the higher and more
  perfectly organised animals are, with but few exceptions, identical with
  those of France and Germany; while the few species still considered to be
  peculiar may be accounted for either by an original local distribution,
  by preservation here owing to favourable insular conditions, or by slight
  modifications having been caused by these conditions resulting in a local
  race, sub-species, or species.</p>

  <p><i>Why Britain is Poor in Species.</i>&mdash;The former union of our
  islands with the continent, is not, however, the only recent change they
  have undergone. There have been partial submergences to the depth of from
  one hundred to perhaps three hundred feet over a large part of our
  country; while during the period of maximum glaciation the whole area
  north of the Thames was buried in snow and ice. Even the south of England
  must have suffered the rigour of an almost arctic climate, since Mr.
  Clement Reid has shown that floating ice brought granite blocks from the
  Channel Islands to the coast of Sussex. Such conditions must have almost
  exterminated our preexisting fauna and flora, and it was only during the
  subsequent union of Britain with the continent that the bulk of existing
  animals and plants could have entered our islands. We know that just
  before and during the glacial period we possessed a fauna almost or quite
  identical with that of adjacent parts of the continent and equally rich
  in species. The glaciation and submergence destroyed much of this fauna;
  and the permanent change of climate on the passing away of the glacial
  conditions appears to have led to the extinction or migration of many
  species in the adjacent continental areas, where they were succeeded by
  the assemblage of animals now occupying Central Europe. When England
  became continental, these entered our country; but sufficient time does
  not seem to have elapsed for the migration to have been completed before
  subsidence again occurred, cutting off the further influx of purely
  terrestrial animals, and leaving us without the number of species which
  our favourable climate and varied surface entitle us to. <!-- Page 339
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page339"></a>{339}</span></p>

  <p>To this cause we must impute our comparative poverty in mammalia and
  reptiles&mdash;more marked in the latter than the former, owing to their
  lower vital activity and smaller powers of dispersal. Germany, for
  example, possesses nearly ninety species of land mammalia, and even
  Scandinavia about sixty, while Britain has only forty, and Ireland only
  twenty-two. The depth of the Irish Sea being somewhat greater than that
  of the German Ocean, the connecting land would there probably be of small
  extent and of less duration, thus offering an additional barrier to
  migration, whence has arisen the comparative zoological poverty of
  Ireland. This poverty attains its maximum in the reptiles, as shown by
  the following figures:&mdash;</p>

</table>

  <p>Where the power of flight existed, and thus the period of migration
  was prolonged, the difference is less marked; so that Ireland has seven
  bats to twelve in Britain, and about 110 as against 130 land-birds.</p>

  <p>Plants, which have considerable facilities for passing over the sea,
  are somewhat intermediate in proportionate numbers, there being about 970
  flowering plants and ferns in Ireland to 1,425 in Great Britain,&mdash;or
  almost exactly two-thirds, a proportion intermediate between that
  presented by the birds and the mammalia.</p>

  <p><i>Peculiar British Birds.</i>&mdash;Among our native mammalia,
  reptiles, and amphibia, it is the opinion of the best authorities that we
  possess neither a distinct species nor distinguishable variety. In birds,
  however, the case is different, since some of our species, in particular
  our coal-tit and long-tailed tit, present well-marked differences of
  colour as compared with continental specimens; and in Mr. Dresser's work
  on the <i>Birds of Europe</i> they are considered to be distinct species,
  while Professor Newton, in his new edition of Yarrell's <i>British
  Birds</i>, does not consider the difference to be sufficiently great or
  sufficiently constant to warrant this, and therefore classes <!-- Page
  340 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page340"></a>{340}</span>them as
  insular races of the continental species. We have, however, one undoubted
  case of a bird peculiar to the British Isles, in the red grouse
  (<i>Lagopus scoticus</i>), which abounds in Scotland, Ireland, the north
  of England, and Wales, and is very distinct from any continental species,
  although closely allied to the willow grouse of Scandinavia. This latter
  species resembles it considerably in its summer plumage, but becomes pure
  white in winter; whereas our species retains its dark plumage throughout
  the year, becoming even darker in winter than in summer. We have here
  therefore a most interesting example of an insular form in our own
  country; but it is difficult to determine how it originated. On the one
  hand, it may be an old continental species which during the glacial epoch
  found a refuge here when driven from its native haunts by the advancing
  ice; or, on the other hand, it may be a descendant of the Northern willow
  grouse, which has lost its power of turning white in winter owing to its
  long residence in the lowlands of an island where there is little
  permanent snow, and where assimilation in colour to the heather among
  which it lurks is at all times its best protection. In either case it is
  equally interesting, as the one large and handsome bird which is peculiar
  to our islands notwithstanding their recent separation from the
  continent.</p>

  <p>The following is a list of the birds now held to be peculiar to the
  British Isles:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Freshwater Fishes.</i>&mdash;Although the productions of fresh
  waters have generally, as Mr. Darwin has shown, a wide range, fishes
  appear to form an exception, many of them being extremely limited in
  distribution. Some are confined to particular river valleys or even to
  single rivers, others inhabit the lakes of a limited district only, while
  some are <!-- Page 341 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page341"></a>{341}</span>confined to single lakes, often of small
  area, and these latter offer examples of the most restricted distribution
  of any organisms whatever. Cases of this kind are found in our own
  islands, and deserve our especial attention. It has long been known that
  some of our lakes possessed peculiar species of trout and charr, but how
  far these were unknown on the continent, and how many of those in
  different parts of our islands were really distinct, had not been
  ascertained till Dr. Günther, so well known for his extensive knowledge
  of the species of fishes, obtained numerous specimens from every part of
  the country, and by comparison with all known continental species
  determined their specific differences. The striking and unexpected result
  has thus been attained, that no less than fifteen well-marked species of
  freshwater fishes are altogether peculiar to the British Islands. The
  following is the list, with their English names and localities:&mdash;<a

  <p>These fifteen peculiar fishes differ from each other and from all
  British and continental species, not in colour only, but in such
  important structural characters as the number and size of the scales,
  form and size of the fins, and the form or proportions of the head, body,
  or tail. Some of them, like <i>S. killinensis</i> and the Coregoni are in
  fact, as Dr. Günther assures me, just as good and distinct species as any
  other recognised species of fish. It may indeed be objected that, until
  all the small lakes of Scandinavia are explored, and their fishes
  compared with ours, we cannot be sure that we have any peculiar species.
  But this objection has very little weight if we consider how our own
  species vary from lake to lake and from island to island, so that the
  Orkney species is not found in Scotland, and only one of the peculiar
  British species extends to Ireland, which has no less than five species
  altogether peculiar to it. If the species of our own two islands are thus
  distinct, what reason have we for believing that they will be otherwise
  than distinct from those of Scandinavia? At all events, with the amount
  of evidence we already possess of the very restricted ranges of many of
  our species, we must certainly hold them to be peculiar till they have
  been proved to be otherwise.</p>

  <p>The great speciality of the Irish fishes is very interesting, because
  it is just what we should expect on the theory of evolution. In Ireland
  the two main causes of specific change&mdash;isolation and altered
  conditions&mdash;are each more powerful than in Britain. Whatever
  difficulty continental fishes may have in passing over to Britain, that
  difficulty will certainly be increased by the second sea passage to
  Ireland; and the latter country has been longer isolated, for the Irish
  Sea with its northern and southern channels is considerably deeper than
  the German Ocean and the <!-- Page 343 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page343"></a>{343}</span>Eastern half of the English Channel, so
  that, when the last subsidence occurred, Ireland would have been an
  island for some length of time while England and Scotland still formed
  part of the continent. Again, whatever differences have been produced by
  the exceptional climate of our islands will have been greater in Ireland,
  where insular conditions are at a maximum, the abundance of moisture and
  the equability of temperature being far more pronounced than in any other
  part of Europe.</p>

  <p>Among the remarkable instances of limited distribution afforded by
  these fishes, we have the Loch Stennis trout confined to the little group
  of lakes in the mainland of Orkney, occupying altogether an area of about
  ten miles by three; the Welsh charr confined to the Llanberris lakes,
  about three miles in length; Gray's charr confined to Lough Melvin, about
  seven miles long; while the Loch Killin charr, known only from a small
  mountain lake in Inverness-shire, and the vendace, from the equally small
  lakes at Loch Maben in Scotland, are two examples of restricted
  distribution which can hardly be surpassed.</p>

  <p><i>Cause of Great Speciality in Fishes.</i>&mdash;The reason why
  fishes alone should exhibit such remarkable local modifications in lakes
  and islands is sufficiently obvious. It is due to the extreme rarity of
  their transmission from one lake to another. Just as we found to be the
  case in Oceanic Islands, where the means of transmission were ample
  hardly any modification of species occurred, while where these means were
  deficient and individuals once transported remained isolated during a
  long succession of ages, their forms and characters became so much
  changed as to bring about what we term distinct species or even distinct
  genera,&mdash;so these lake fishes have become modified because the means
  by which they are enabled to migrate so rarely occur. It is quite in
  accordance with this view that some of the smaller lakes contain no
  fishes, because none have ever been conveyed to them. Others contain
  several; and some fishes which have peculiarities of constitution or
  habits which render their transmission somewhat less difficult occur in
  several lakes over a wide area of country, though only one appears to be
  common to the British and Irish lakes. <!-- Page 344 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page344"></a>{344}</span></p>

  <p>The manner in which fishes are enabled to migrate from lake to lake is
  unknown, but many suggestions have been made. It is a fact that
  whirlwinds and waterspouts sometimes carry living fish in considerable
  numbers and drop them on the land. Here is one mode which might certainly
  have acted now and then in the course of thousands of years, and the eggs
  of fishes may have been carried with even greater ease. Again we may well
  suppose that some of these fish have once inhabited the streams that
  enter or flow out of the lakes as well as the lakes themselves; and this
  opens a wide field for conjecture as to modes of migration, because we
  know that rivers have sometimes changed their courses to such an extent
  as to form a union with distinct river basins. This has been effected
  either by floods rising over low watersheds, by elevations of the land
  changing lines of drainage, or by ice blocking up valleys and compelling
  the streams to flow over watersheds to find an outlet. This is known to
  have occurred during the glacial epoch, and is especially manifest in the
  case of the Parallel Roads of Glenroy, and it probably affords the true
  solution of many of the cases in which existing species of fish inhabit
  distinct river basins whether in streams or lakes. If a fish thus
  wandered out of one river-basin into another, it might then retire up the
  streams to some of the lakes, where alone it might find conditions
  favourable to it. By a combination of the modes of migration here
  indicated it is not difficult to understand how so many species are now
  common to the lakes of Wales, Cumberland, and Scotland, while others less
  able to adapt themselves to different conditions have survived only in
  one or two lakes in a single district; or these last may have been
  originally identical with other forms, but have become modified by the
  particular conditions of the lake in which they have found themselves
  isolated.</p>

  <p><i>Peculiar British Insects.</i>&mdash;We now come to the class of
  insects, and here we have much more difficulty in determining what are
  the actual facts, because new species are still being yearly discovered
  and considerable portions of Europe are but imperfectly explored. It
  often happens that an insect is discovered in our islands, and for some
  <!-- Page 345 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page345"></a>{345}</span>years Britain is its only recorded
  locality; but at length it is found on some part of the continent, and
  not unfrequently has been all the time known there, but disguised by
  another name, or by being classed as a variety of some other species.
  This has occurred so often that our best entomologists have come to take
  it for granted that <i>all</i> our supposed peculiar British species are
  really natives of the continent and will one day be found there; and
  owing to this feeling little trouble has been taken to bring together the
  names of such as from time to time remain known from this country only.
  The view of the probable identity of our entire insect-fauna with that of
  the continent has been held by such well-known authorities as the late
  Mr. E.&nbsp;C. Rye and Dr. D. Sharp for the beetles, and by Mr. H.&nbsp;T. Stainton
  for butterflies and moths; but as we have already seen that among two
  orders of vertebrates&mdash;birds and fishes&mdash;there are undoubtedly
  peculiar British species, it seems to me that all the probabilities are
  in favour of there being a much larger number of peculiar species of
  insects. In every other island where some of the vertebrates are
  peculiar&mdash;as in the Azores, the Canaries, the Andaman Islands, and
  Ceylon&mdash;the insects show an equal if not a higher proportion of
  speciality, and there seems no reason whatever why the same law should
  not apply to us. Our climate is undoubtedly very distinct from that of
  any part of the continent, and in Scotland, Ireland, and Wales we possess
  extensive tracts of wild mountainous country where a moist uniform
  climate, an alpine or northern vegetation, and a considerable amount of
  isolation, offer all the conditions requisite for the preservation of
  some species which may have become extinct elsewhere, and for the slight
  modification of others since our last separation from the continent. I
  think, therefore, that it will be very interesting to take stock, as it
  were, of our recorded peculiarities in the insect world, for it is only
  by so doing that we can hope to arrive at any correct solution of the
  question on which there is at present so much difference of opinion. For
  the list of Coleoptera with the accompanying notes I was originally
  indebted to the late Mr. E.&nbsp;C. Rye; and Dr. Sharp also gave me valuable
  information as to the recent <!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page346"></a>{346}</span>occurrence of some of the supposed
  peculiar species on the continent. The list has now been revised by the
  Rev. Canon Fowler, author of the best modern work on the British
  Coleoptera, who has kindly furnished some valuable notes.</p>

  <p>For the Lepidoptera I first noted all the species and varieties marked
  as British only in Staudinger's Catalogue of European Lepidoptera. This
  list was carefully corrected by Mr. Stainton, who weeded out all the
  species known by him to have been since discovered, and furnished me with
  valuable information on the distribution and habits of the species. This
  information often has a direct bearing on the probability of the insect
  being peculiar to Britain, and in some cases may be said to explain why
  it should be so. For example, the larvæ of some of our peculiar species
  of Tineina feed during the winter, which they are enabled to do owing to
  our mild and insular climate, but which the severer continental winters
  render impossible. A curious example of the effect this habit may have on
  distribution is afforded by one of our commonest British species,
  <i>Elachista rufocinerea</i>, the <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `lava'.">larva</span> of which mines in the leaves
  of <i>Holcus mollis</i> and other grasses from December to March. This
  species, though common everywhere with us, extending to Scotland and
  Ireland, is quite unknown in similar latitudes on the continent, but
  appears again in Italy, the South of France, and Dalmatia, where the mild
  winters enable it to live in its accustomed manner.</p>

  <p>Such cases as this afford an excellent illustration of those changes
  of distribution, dependent probably on recent changes of climate, which
  may have led to the restriction of certain species to our islands. For
  should any change of climate lead to the extinction of the species in
  South Europe, where it is far less abundant than with us, we should have
  a common and wide-spread species entirely restricted to our islands.
  Other species feed in the larva state on our common gorse, a plant found
  only in limited portions of Western and Southern Europe; and the presence
  of this plant in a mild and insular climate such as ours may well be
  supposed to have led to the preservation of some of the numerous species
  which are or have been dependent on it. Since the first edition was <!--
  Page 347 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page347"></a>{347}</span>published many new British species have
  been discovered, while some of the supposed peculiar species have been
  found on the continent. Information as to these has been kindly furnished
  by Mr. W. Warren, Mr. C.&nbsp;G. Barrett, Lord Walsingham, and other students
  of British Lepidoptera, and the first-named gentleman has also looked
  over the proofs.</p>

  <p>Mr. McLachlan has kindly furnished me with some valuable information
  on certain species of Trichoptera or Caddis flies which seem to be
  peculiar to our islands; and this completes the list of orders which have
  been studied with sufficient care to afford materials for such a
  comparison. We will now give the list of peculiar British Insects,
  beginning with the Lepidoptera and adding such notes as have been
  supplied by the gentlemen already referred to.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Diurni.</span></p>

  <p>1. <span class="sc">Polyommatus dispar.</span> "The large copper."
  This fine insect, once common in the fens, but now extinct owing to
  extensive drainage, is generally admitted to be peculiar to our island,
  at all events as a variety or local form. Its continental ally differs
  constantly in being smaller and in having smaller spots; but the
  difference, though constant, is so slight that it is now classed as a
  variety under the name of <i>rutilus</i>. Our insect may therefore be
  stated to be a well-marked local form of a continental species.</p>

  <p>2. Lycæna astrarche, <i>var.</i> <span class="sc">artaxerxes</span>.
  This very distinct form is confined to Scotland and the north of England.
  The species of which it is considered a variety (more generally known to

</blockquote>

  <p>We have here a list of eighty-nine species, which, according to the
  best authorities, are, in the present state of our knowledge, peculiar to
  Britain. It is a curious fact that no less than fifty of these have been
  described more than twenty-five years; and as during all that time they
  have not been recognised on the continent, notwithstanding that good
  coloured figures exist of almost all of them, it seems highly probable
  that many of them are really confined to our island. At the same time we
  must not apply this argument too rigidly, for the very day before my
  visit to Mr. Stainton he had received a letter from Professor Zeller
  announcing the discovery on the continent of a species of our last
  family, Pterophorina, which for more than forty years had been considered
  to be exclusively British. This insect, <i>Platyptilia similidactyla</i>
  (<i>Pterophorus isodactylus</i>, Stainton's <i>Manual</i>), had been
  taken rarely in the extreme north and south of our
  islands&mdash;Teignmouth and Orkney, a fact which seemed somewhat
  indicative of its being a straggler. Again, seven of the species are
  unique, that is, have only been captured once; and it may be supposed
  that, as they are so rare as to have been found only once in England,
  they may be all <!-- Page 351 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page351"></a>{351}</span>equally rare and not yet found on the
  continent. But this is hardly in accordance with the laws of
  distribution. Widely scattered species are generally abundant in some
  localities; while, when a species is on the point of extinction, it must
  for a time be very rare in the single locality where it last maintains
  itself. It is then more probable that some of these unique species
  represent such as are almost extinct, than that they have a wide range
  and are equally rare everywhere; and the peculiarity of our insular
  climate, combined with our varied soil and vegetation, offer conditions
  which may favour the survival of some species with us after they have
  become extinct on the continent.</p>

  <p>Of the sixty-nine species recorded in my first edition fourteen have
  been since discovered on the continent, while no less than twenty-two
  species and eleven varieties have been added to the list. As we can
  hardly suppose continental entomologists to be less thorough collectors
  than ourselves, it ought to be more and more difficult to find any
  insects which are unknown on the continent if all ours really exist
  there; and the fact that the list of apparently peculiar British species
  is an increasing one renders it probable that many of them are not only
  apparently but really so. Both general considerations dependent on the
  known laws of distribution, and the peculiar habits, conspicuous
  appearance, and restricted range, of many of our species, alike indicate
  that some considerable proportion of them will remain permanently as
  peculiar British species.</p>

  <p>We will now pass on to the Coleoptera, or beetles, an order which has
  been of late years energetically collected and carefully studied by
  British entomologists.</p>

  <p>Of the sixty-seven species and varieties of beetles in the preceding
  list, a considerable number no doubt owe their presence there to the fact
  that they have not yet been discovered or recognised on the continent.
  This is almost certainly the case with many of those which have been
  separated from other species by very minute and obscure characters, and
  especially with the excessively minute Trichopterygidæ described by Mr.
  Matthews. There are others, however, to which this mode of getting rid of
  them will not apply, as they are so marked as to be at once recognised by
  any competent entomologist, and often so plentiful that they can be
  easily obtained when searched for. The peculiar species of Apion in the
  Shetland Islands is interesting, and may be connected with the very
  peculiar climatal conditions there prevailing, which have led in some
  cases to a change of habits, so that a species of weevil (<i>Otiorhynchus
  maurus</i>) always found on mountain sides in Scotland here occurs on the
  sea-shore. Still more curious is the occurrence of two distinct forms (a
  species and a well-marked variety) on the small granitic Lundy Island in
  the Bristol Channel. This island is about three miles long and twelve
  from the coast of Devonshire, consisting mainly of granite with a little
  of the Devonian formation, and the presence here of peculiar insects can
  only be due to isolation with special conditions, and immunity from
  enemies or competing forms. When we consider the similar islands off <!--
  Page 355 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page355"></a>{355}</span>the
  coast of Scotland and Ireland, with the Isle of Man and the Scilly
  Islands, none of which have been yet thoroughly explored for beetles, it
  is probable that many similar examples of peculiar isolated forms remain
  to be discovered.</p>

  <p>Looking, then, at what seem to me the probabilities of the case from
  the standpoint of evolution and natural selection, and giving due weight
  to the facts of local distribution as they are actually presented to us,
  I am forced to differ from the opinion held by our best entomological
  authorities, and to believe that some at least, perhaps many, of the
  species which, in the present state of our knowledge, appear to be
  peculiar to our islands, are, not only apparently, but really, so
  peculiar.</p>

  <p>I am indebted to Mr. Robert McLachlan for the following information on
  certain Trichopterous Neuroptera (or caddis-flies) which appear to be
  confined to our islands. The peculiar aquatic habits of the larvæ of
  these insects, some living in ponds or rivers, others in lakes, and
  others again only in clear mountain streams, render it not improbable
  that some of them should have become isolated and preserved in our
  islands, or that they should be modified owing to such isolation.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Trichoptera peculiar to the British Isles.</i></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>1. <span class="sc">Philopotamus insularis.</span> (? A variety of
  <i>P. montanus</i>.)&mdash;This can hardly be termed a British species or
  variety, because, so far as at present known, it is peculiar to the
  Island of Guernsey. It agrees structurally with <i>P. montanus</i>, a
  species found both in Britain and on the continent, but it differs in its
  strikingly yellow colour, and less pronounced markings. All the specimens
  from Guernsey are alike, and resident entomologists assured Mr. McLachlan
  that no other kind is known. Strange to say, some examples from Jersey
  differ considerably, resembling the common European and British form.
  Even should this peculiar variety be at some future time found on the
  continent it would still be a remarkable fact that the form of insect
  inhabiting two small islands only twenty miles apart should constantly
  differ; but as Jersey is between Guernsey and the coast, it seems just
  possible that the more insular conditions, and perhaps some peculiarity
  of the soil and water in the former island, have really led to the
  production or preservation of a well-marked variety of insect. In the
  first edition of this work two other species were named as then, peculiar
  to Britain&mdash;Setodes argentipunctella and Rhyacophila munda, but both
  have now been taken on the continent.</p>

  <p>2. <span class="sc">Mesophylax impunctatus</span>, <i>var.</i> <span
  class="sc">zetlandicus</span>.&mdash;A variety of a South and Central
  European species, one specimen of which has been found in Dumfriesshire.
  The variety is distinguished by its small size and dark colour.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 356 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page356"></a>{356}</span></p>

  <p><i>Land and Freshwater Shells.</i>&mdash;In the first edition of this
  work four species were noted as being, so far as was then known,
  exclusively British. Two of these, <i>Cyclas pisidioides</i> (now called
  <i>Sphærium pisidioides</i>) and <i>Geomalacus maculosus</i>, have been
  discovered on the continent, but the other two remain still apparently
  confined to these islands; and to these another has been added by the
  discovery of a new species of Hydrobia in the estuary of the Thames. The
  peculiar species now stands as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>1. <span class="sc">Limnea involuta.</span>&mdash;A pond snail with a
  small polished amber-coloured shell found only in a small alpine lake and
  its inflowing stream on Cromagloun mountain near the lakes of Killarney.
  It was discovered in 1838, and has frequently been obtained since in the
  same locality. It is sometimes classed as a variety of <i>Limnea
  peregra</i>, and is at all events closely allied to that species.</p>

  <p>2. <span class="sc">Hydrobia jenkinsii.</span>&mdash;A small shell of
  the family Rissoidæ inhabiting the Thames estuary both in Essex and Kent.
  It was discovered only a few years ago, and was first described in
  1889.</p>

  <p>3. <span class="sc">Assiminea grayana.</span>&mdash;A small estuarine
  pulmonobranch found on the banks of the Thames between Greenwich and
  Gravesend, on mud at the roots of aquatic plants. It has been discovered
  more than sixty years.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But besides the above-named species there are a considerable number of
  well-marked varieties of shells which seem to be peculiar to our islands.
  A list of these has been kindly furnished me by Mr. Theo. D.&nbsp;A.
  Cockerell, who has paid much attention to the subject; and after omitting
  all those whose peculiarities are very slight or whose absence from the
  continent is doubtful, there remain a series of forms some of which are
  in all probability really endemic with us. This is the more probable from
  the fact that an introduced colony of <i>Helix nemoralis</i> at
  Lexington, Virginia, presents numerous varieties among which are several
  which do not occur in Europe.<a name="NtA_136"
  href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> The following list is therefore given
  in the hope that it may be useful in calling attention to those varieties
  which are not yet positively known to occur elsewhere than in our
  islands, and <!-- Page 357 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page357"></a>{357}</span>thus lead, ultimately, to a more accurate
  knowledge of the facts. It is only by obtaining a full knowledge of
  varieties, their distribution and their comparative stability, that we
  can ever hope to detect the exact process by which nature works in the
  formation of species.</p>

  <p><i>Peculiarities of the British Flora.</i>&mdash;Thinking it probable
  that there must also be some peculiar British plants, but not finding any
  enumeration of such in the <i>British Floras</i> of Babington, Hooker, or
  Bentham, I applied to the greatest living authority on the distribution
  of British plants&mdash;the late Mr. H.&nbsp;C. Watson, who very kindly gave
  me the information I required, and I cannot do better than quote his
  words: "It may be stated pretty confidently that there is no 'species'
  (generally accepted among botanists as a good species) peculiar to the
  British Isles. True, during the past hundred years, nominally new species
  have been named and described on British specimens only, from time to
  time. But these have gradually come to be identified with species
  described elsewhere under other names&mdash;or they have been reduced in
  rank by succeeding botanists, and placed or replaced as varieties of more
  widely distributed species. In his <i>British Rubi</i> Professor
  Babington includes as good species, some half-dozen which he has,
  apparently, not identified with any foreign species or variety. None of
  these are accepted as 'true species,' nor even as 'sub-species' in the
  <i>Students' Flora</i>, where the brambles are described by Baker, a
  botanist well acquainted with the plants of Britain. And as all these
  nominal species of Rubi are of late creation, they have truly never been
  subjected to real or critical tests as 'species.'"</p>

  <p>In my first edition I was only able to name four species, sub-species,
  or varieties of flowering plants which were believed to be unknown on the
  continent. But much attention has of late years been paid to the critical
  examination of British plants in comparison with continental specimens,
  and I am now enabled to give a much more <!-- Page 360 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page360"></a>{360}</span>extensive list of the
  species or forms which at present seem to be peculiar. For the following
  list I am primarily indebted to Mr. Arthur Bennett of Croydon. Sir Joseph
  Hooker has been so kind as to examine it carefully and to give me his
  conclusions on the relative value of the differences of the several
  forms, and Mr. Baker, of Kew, has also assisted with his extensive
  knowledge of British plants.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In his comments on this extensive list of supposed peculiar British
  plants, Sir Joseph Hooker arrives at the following
  conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>1. There are four unquestionably distinct species which do not occur
  in continental Europe: viz.&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>One</i> absolutely endemic species, <span class="sc">Potamogeton
  lanceolatus</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Three</i> American species, <span class="sc">Sisyrinchium
  angustifolium</span>, <span class="sc">Spiranthes romanzoviana</span>,
  <span class="sc">Eriocaulon septangulare</span>.</p>

  <p>2. There are sixteen endemic varieties of British species,
  viz.&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Eleven</i> of more or less variable species, Caltha palustris,
  <i>var.</i> <span class="sc">radicans</span>; Polygala vulgaris,
  <i>var.</i> <span class="sc">grandiflora</span>; Cerastium arcticum,
  <i>var.</i> <span class="sc">edmonstonii</span>; Trifolium repens,

  Phellandrium, <i>var.</i> <span class="sc">fluviatilis</span>; Spartium
  stricta, <i>var.</i> <span class="sc">Townsendi</span>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The above twenty species are marked in the list with an asterisk. Of
  the remaining fifty-five, Sir Joseph Hooker says, "that for various
  reasons it would not be safe to rely on them as evidence. In most cases
  the varietal form is so very trifling a departure from the type that this
  may be safely set down to a local cause, and is probably not constant. In
  others the plant is doubtfully endemic; in still others a hybrid."</p>

  <p>Even should it ultimately prove that of the whole number of the
  fifty-five doubtful forms none are established as peculiar British
  varieties, the number admitted after so <!-- Page 364 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page364"></a>{364}</span>rigorous an examination
  is about what we should expect in comparison with the limited amount of
  speciality we have seen to exist in other groups. The three American
  species which inhabit the extreme west and north-west of the British
  Isles, but are not found on the continent of Europe are especially
  interesting, because they demonstrate the existence of some peculiar
  conditions such as would help to explain the presence of the other
  peculiar species. Whether we suppose these American forms to have
  migrated from America to Europe before the glacial epoch, or to be the
  remnants of a vegetation once spread over the north temperate zone, we
  can only explain their presence with us and not further east by something
  favourable either in our insular climate or in the limited competition
  due to our comparative poverty in species.</p>

  <p>About half of the peculiar forms are found in the extreme west or
  north of Britain or in Ireland, where peculiar insular conditions are at
  a maximum; and the influence of these conditions is further shown by the
  number of species of West or South European plants which occur in the
  same districts.</p>

  <p>We may here notice the interesting fact that Ireland possesses no less
  than twenty species or sub-species of flowering plants not found in
  Britain, and some of these <i>may</i> be altogether peculiar. As a whole
  they show the effect of the pre-eminently mild and insular climate of
  Ireland in extending the range of some south European species. The
  following list of these plants, for which I am indebted to Mr. A.&nbsp;G.
  More, with a few remarks on their distribution, will be found
  interesting:&mdash;</p>

  <p>We find here nine south-west European species which probably had a
  wider range in mild preglacial times, and have been preserved in the
  south and west of Ireland owing to its milder climate. It must be
  remembered that during the height of the glacial epoch Ireland was
  continental, so that these plants may have followed the retreating ice to
  their present stations and survived the subsequent depression. This seems
  more probable than that so many species should have reached Ireland for
  the first time during the last union with the continent subsequent to the
  glacial epoch. The Arctic, Alpine, and American plants may all be
  examples of species which once had a wider range, and which, owing to the
  more favourable conditions, have continued to exist in Ireland while
  becoming extinct in the adjacent parts of Britain and Western Europe.</p>

  <p>As contrasted with the extreme scarcity of peculiar species among the
  flowering plants, it is the more interesting and unexpected to find a
  considerable number of peculiar mosses and Hepaticæ, some of which
  present us with phenomena of distribution of a very remarkable character.
  For the following lists and the information as to the distribution of the
  genera and species I am indebted to Mr. William Mitten, one of the first
  authorities on these beautiful little plants. That of the mosses has been
  corrected for this edition by Dr. R. Braithwaite, and several species of
  hepaticæ have been added by Mr. Mitten. <!-- Page 366 --><span

  <p>Many of the above are minute or obscure plants, and are closely allied
  to other European species with which they may have been confounded. We
  cannot therefore lay any stress on these individually as being absent
  from the continent of Europe so much of which is imperfectly explored,
  though it is probable that several of them are really confined to
  Britain. But there are a few&mdash;indicated by italics&mdash;which are
  in a very different category; for they belong to genera which are
  altogether unknown in any other part of Europe, and their nearest allies
  are to be found in the tropics or in the southern hemisphere. The four
  non-European genera of mosses to which we refer all have their maximum of
  development in the Andes, while the three non-European Hepaticæ appear to
  have their maximum in the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere.
  Mr. Mitten has kindly furnished me with the following particulars of the
  distribution of these genera:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><span class="sc">Bartramidula.</span> Asia, Africa, S. America and
  Australia, but not Europe or N. America.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Streptopogon</span> is a comparatively small genus,
  with seven species in the Andes, one in the Himalayas, and three in the
  south temperate zone, besides our English species.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Daltonia</span> is a large genus of inconspicuous
  mosses, having seventeen species in the Andes, two in Brazil, two in
  Mexico, one in the Galapagos, six in India and Ceylon, five in Java, two
  in Africa, and three in the Antarctic Islands, and one in Ireland.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Hookeria</span> (restricting that term to the species
  referable to Cyclodictyon) is still a large genus of handsome and
  remarkable mosses, having twenty-six species in the Andes, eleven in
  Brazil, eight in the Antilles, one in Mexico, two in the Pacific Islands,
  one in New Zealand, one in Java, one in India, and five in
  Africa&mdash;besides our British species, which is found also in Madeira
  and the Azores but in no part of Europe proper.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These last two are very remarkable cases of distribution, since Mr.
  Mitten assures me that the plants are so markedly different from all
  other mosses that they would scarcely be overlooked in Europe.</p>

  <p>The distribution of the non-European genera of Hepaticæ is as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><span class="sc">Chasmatocolia.</span> South America and Ireland.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Acrobolbus</span>. A small genus found only in New
  Zealand and the adjacent islands, besides Ireland.</p>

<p><!-- Page 368 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page368"></a>{368}</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Petalophyllum.</span> A small genus confined to
  Australia and New Zealand in the southern hemisphere, Algeria, and
  Ireland in the northern. We have also one of the
  Hepaticæ&mdash;<i>Mastigophora Woodsii</i>&mdash;found in Ireland and the
  Himalayas, but unknown in any part of continental Europe. The genus is
  most developed in New Zealand.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These are certainly very interesting facts, but they are by no means
  so exceptional in this group of plants as to throw any doubt upon their
  accuracy. The Atlantic islands present very similar phenomena in the
  <i>Rhamphidium purpuratum</i>, whose nearest allies are in the West
  Indies and South America; and in three species of Sciaromium, whose only
  allies are in New Zealand, Tasmania, and the Andes of Bogota. An
  analogous and equally curious fact is the occurrence in the Drontheim
  mountains in Central Norway, of a little group of four or five peculiar
  species of mosses of the genus Mnium, which are found nowhere else;
  although the genus extends over Europe, India, and the southern
  hemisphere, but always represented by a very few wide-ranging species
  except in this one mountain group!<a name="NtA_137"
  href="#Nt_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Such facts show us the wonderful delicacy of the balance of conditions
  which determine the existence of particular species in any locality. The
  spores of mosses and Hepaticæ are so minute that they must be continually
  carried through the air to great distances, and we can hardly doubt that,
  so far as its powers of diffusion are concerned, any species which fruits
  freely might soon spread itself over the whole world. That they do not do
  so must depend on peculiarities of habit and constitution, which fit the
  different species for restricted stations and special climatic
  conditions; and according as the adaptation is more general, or the
  degree of specialisation extreme, species will have wide or restricted
  ranges. Although their fossil remains have been rarely detected, we can
  hardly doubt that mosses have as high an antiquity as ferns or Lycopods;
  and coupling this antiquity with their great powers of dispersal we may
  understand how many of the genera have come to occupy a number of
  detached areas scattered over the whole earth, but <!-- Page 369 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page369"></a>{369}</span>always such as afford
  the peculiar conditions of climate and soil best suited to them. The
  repeated changes of temperature and other climatic conditions, which, as
  we have seen, occurred through all the later geological epochs, combined
  with those slower changes caused by geographical mutations, must have
  greatly affected the distribution of such ubiquitous yet delicately
  organised plants as mosses. Throughout countless ages they must have been
  in a constant state of comparatively rapid migration, driven to and fro
  by every physical and organic change, often subject to modification of
  structure or habit, but always seizing upon every available spot in which
  they could even temporarily maintain themselves.<a name="NtA_138"
  href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Here then we have a group in which there is no question of the means
  of dispersal; and where the difficulties that present themselves are not
  how the species reached the remote localities in which they are now
  found, but rather why they have not established themselves in <!-- Page
  370 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page370"></a>{370}</span>many other
  stations which, so far as we can judge, seem equally suitable to them.
  Yet it is a curious fact, that the phenomena of distribution actually
  presented by this group do not essentially differ from those presented by
  the higher flowering plants which have apparently far less diffusive
  power, as we shall find when we come to treat of the floras of oceanic
  islands; and we believe that the explanation of this is, that the life of
  <i>species</i>, and especially of <i>genera</i>, is often so prolonged as
  to extend over whole cycles of such terrestrial mutations as we have just
  referred to; and that thus the majority of plants are afforded means of
  dispersal which are usually sufficient to carry them into all suitable
  localities on the globe. Hence it follows that their actual existence in
  such localities depends mainly upon vigour of constitution and adaptation
  to conditions just as it does in the case of the lower and more rapidly
  diffused groups, and only partially on superior facilities for diffusion.
  This important principle will be used further on to afford a solution of
  some of the most difficult problems in the distribution of plant life.<a
  name="NtA_139" href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Concluding Remarks on the Peculiarities of the British Fauna and
  Flora.</i>&mdash;The facts, now I believe for the first time brought
  together, respecting the peculiarities of the British fauna and flora,
  are sufficient to show that there is considerable scope for the study of
  geographical distribution even in so apparently unpromising a field as
  one of the most recent of continental islands. Looking at the general
  bearing of these facts, they prove, that the idea so generally
  entertained as to the biological identity of the British Isles with the
  adjacent continent is not altogether correct. Among birds we have
  undoubted peculiarities in at least three instances; peculiar fishes are
  much more numerous, and in this case the fact that the Irish species <!--
  Page 371 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page371"></a>{371}</span>are
  almost all different from the British, and those of the Orkneys distinct
  from those of Scotland, renders it almost certain that the great majority
  of the fifteen peculiar British fishes are really peculiar and will never
  be found on the European Continent. The mosses and Hepaticæ also have
  been sufficiently collected in Europe to render it pretty certain that
  the more remarkable of the peculiar British forms are not found there;
  why therefore, it may be well asked, should there not be a proportionate
  number of peculiar British insects? It is true that numerous species have
  been first discovered in Britain, and, subsequently, on the continent;
  but we have many species which have been known for twenty, thirty, or
  forty years, some of which are not rare with us, and yet have never been
  found on the continent. We have also the curious fact of our outlying
  islands, such as the Shetland Isles, the Isle of Man, and the little
  Lundy Island, possessing each some peculiar forms which,
  <i>certainly</i>, do not exist on our principal island which has been so
  very thoroughly worked. Analogy, therefore, would lead us to conclude
  that many other species or varieties would exist on our islands and not
  on the continent; and when we find that a very large number (150) in
  three orders only, are so recorded, we may I think be sure that some
  considerable portion of these (though how many we cannot say) are really
  endemic British species.</p>

  <p>The general laws of distribution also lead us to expect such
  phenomena. Very rare and very local species are such as are becoming
  extinct; and it is among insects, which are so excessively varied and
  abundant, which present so many isolated forms, and which, even on
  continents, afford numerous examples of very rare species confined to
  restricted areas, that we should have the best chance of meeting with
  every degree of rarity down to the point of almost complete extinction.
  But we know that in all parts of the world islands are the refuge of
  species or groups which have become extinct elsewhere; and it is
  therefore in the highest degree probable that some species which have
  ceased to exist on the continent should be preserved in some part or
  other of our islands, especially <!-- Page 372 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page372"></a>{372}</span>as these present
  favourable climatic conditions such as do not exist elsewhere.</p>

  <p>There is therefore a considerable amount of harmony in the various
  facts adduced in this chapter, as well as a complete accordance with what
  the laws of distribution in islands would lead us to expect. In
  proportion to the species of birds and fresh-water fishes, the number of
  insect-forms is enormously great, so that the numerous species or
  varieties here recorded as not yet known on the continent are not to be
  wondered at; while it would, I think, be almost an anomaly if, with
  peculiar birds and fishes there were <i>not</i> a fair proportion of
  peculiar insects. Our entomologists should, therefore, give up the
  assumption, that all our insects do exist on the continent, and will some
  time or other be found there, as not in accordance either with the
  evidence or the probabilities of the case; and when this is done, and the
  interesting peculiarities of some of our smaller islands are remembered,
  the study of our native animals and plants, in relation to those of other
  countries, will acquire a new interest. The British Isles are said to
  consist of more than a thousand islands and islets. How many of these
  have ever been searched for insects? With the case of Lundy Island before
  us, who shall say that there is not yet scope for extensive and
  interesting investigations into the British fauna and flora?</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As a representative of recent continental islands situated in the
  tropics, we will take Borneo, since, although perhaps not much more
  ancient than Great Britain, it presents a considerable amount of
  speciality; and, in its relations to the surrounding islands and the
  Asiatic continent, offers us some problems of great interest and
  considerable difficulty.</p>

  <p>The accompanying map shows that Borneo is situated on the eastern side
  of a submarine bank of enormous extent, being about 1,200 miles from
  north to south, and 1,500 from east to west, and embracing Java, Sumatra,
  and the Malay Peninsula. This vast area is all included within the 100
  fathom line, but by far the larger part of it&mdash;from the Gulf of Siam
  to the Java Sea&mdash;is under fifty fathoms, or about the same depth as
  the sea that separates our own island from the continent. The distance
  from Borneo to the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula is about 350
  miles, and it is nearly as far from Sumatra and Java, while it is more
  than 600 miles from the Siamese Peninsula, opposite to which its long
  northern coast extends. There is, I believe, nowhere else upon the globe,
  an island so far from a continent, yet separated from it by so shallow a
  sea. Recent changes of sea and land must have occurred here on a grand
  scale, and this adds to the interest attaching to the study of this large
  island.</p>

<p><!-- Page 374 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page374"></a>{374}</span></p>

<p><!-- Page 375 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page375"></a>{375}</span></p>

  <p>The internal geography of Borneo is somewhat peculiar. A large portion
  of its surface is lowland, consisting of great alluvial valleys which
  penetrate far into the interior; while the mountains except in the north,
  are of no great elevation, and there are no extensive plateaux. A
  subsidence of 500 feet would allow the sea to fill the great valleys of
  the Pontianak, Banjarmassing, and Coti rivers, almost to the centre of
  the island, greatly reducing its extent, and causing it to resemble in
  form the island of Celebes to the east of it.</p>

  <p>In geological structure Borneo is thoroughly continental, possessing
  formations of all ages, with basalt and crystalline rocks, but no recent
  volcanoes. It possesses vast beds of coal of Tertiary age; and these, no
  less than the great extent of alluvial deposits in its valleys, indicate
  great changes of level in recent geological times.</p>

  <p>Having thus briefly indicated those physical features of Borneo which
  are necessary for our inquiry, let us turn to the organic world.</p>

  <p>Neither as regards this great island nor those which surround it, have
  we the amount of detailed information in a convenient form that is
  required for a full elucidation of its past history. We have, however, a
  tolerable acquaintance with the two higher groups&mdash;mammalia and
  birds, both of Borneo and of all the surrounding countries, and to these
  alone will it be necessary to refer in any detail. The most convenient
  course, and that which will make the subject easiest for the reader, will
  be to give, first, a connected sketch of what is known of the zoology of
  Borneo itself, with the main conclusions to which they point; and then to
  discuss the mutual relations of some of <!-- Page 376 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page376"></a>{376}</span>the adjacent islands,
  and the series of geographical changes that seem required to explain
  them.</p>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;Nearly a hundred and forty species of mammalia
  have been discovered in Borneo, and of these more than three-fourths are
  identical with those of the surrounding countries, and more than one half
  with those of the continent. Among these are two lemurs, nine civets,
  five cats, five deer, the tapir, the elephant, the rhinoceros, and many
  squirrels, an assemblage which could certainly only have reached the
  country by land. The following species of mammalia are supposed to be
  peculiar to Borneo:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Of the twenty-nine peculiar species here enumerated it is possible
  that a few may be found to be identical with those of Malacca or Sumatra;
  but there are also four peculiar genera which are less likely to be
  discovered elsewhere. These are Nasalis, the remarkable long-nosed
  monkey; Rheithrosciurus, a peculiar form of squirrel; and Trichys, a
  tailless porcupine. These peculiar forms do not, however, imply that the
  separation of the island from the continent is of very ancient date, for
  the country is so vast and <!-- Page 377 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page377"></a>{377}</span>so much of the once connecting land is
  covered with water, that the amount of speciality is hardly, if at all,
  greater than occurs in many continental areas of equal extent and
  remoteness. This will be more evident if we consider that Borneo is as
  large as the Indo-Chinese Peninsula, or as the Indian Peninsula south of
  Bombay, and if either of these countries were separated from the
  continent by the submergence of the whole area north of them as far as
  the Himalayas, they would be found to contain quite as many peculiar
  genera and species as Borneo actually does now. A more decisive test of
  the lapse of time since the separation took place is to be found in the
  presence of a number of representative species closely allied to those of
  the surrounding countries, such as the tailed monkeys and the numerous
  squirrels. These relationships, however, are best seen among the birds,
  which have been more thoroughly collected and more carefully studied than
  the mammalia.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;About 580 species of birds are now known to
  inhabit Borneo, of which 420 species are land-birds.<a name="NtA_140"
  href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> One hundred and eight species are
  supposed to be peculiar to the island, and of these one half have been
  noted, either by Count Salvadori or Mr. Everett, as being either
  representative species of, or closely allied to birds inhabiting other
  islands or countries. The majority of these are, as might be expected,
  allied to species inhabiting the surrounding countries, especially
  Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, or Java, a smaller number having their
  representative forms in the Philippine Islands or Celebes. But there is
  another group of eight species whose nearest allies are found in such
  remote lands as Ceylon, North India, Burma, or China. These last have
  been indicated in the following list by a double star (**) while those
  which are representative of forms found in the immediately surrounding
  area, and are in many cases very slightly differentiated from their
  allies, are indicated by a single star (*). <!-- Page 378 --><span

  <p>Representative forms of the same character as those noted above are
  found in all extensive continental areas, but they are rarely so
  numerous. Thus, in Mr. Elwes' paper on the "Distribution of Asiatic
  Birds," he states that 12.5 per cent. of the land birds of Burmah and
  Tenasserim are peculiar species, whereas we find that in Borneo they are
  about 25 per cent., and the difference may fairly be imputed to the
  greater proportion of slightly modified representative species due to a
  period of complete isolation. Of peculiar genera, the Indo-Chinese
  Peninsula has one&mdash;Ampeliceps, a remarkable yellow-crowned starling,
  with bare pink-coloured orbits; while two others, Temnurus and
  Crypsirhina&mdash;singular birds allied to the jays&mdash;are found in no
  other part of the Asiatic continent though they occur in some of the
  Malay Islands. Borneo has seven peculiar genera of passeres,<a
  name="NtA_141" href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> as well as Hæmatortyx,
  a crested partridge; and Lobiophasis, a pheasant hardly distinct from
  Euplocamus; while two others, Pityriasis, an extraordinary bare-headed
  bird between a jay and a shrike, and Carpococcyx, a pheasant-like ground
  cuckoo formerly thought to be peculiar, are said to have been discovered
  also in Sumatra.</p>

  <p>The insects and land-shells of Borneo and of the surrounding countries
  are too imperfectly known to enable us to arrive at any accurate results
  with regard to their distribution. They agree, however, with the birds
  and mammals in their general approximation to Malayan forms, but the
  number of peculiar species is perhaps larger.</p>

  <p>The proportion here shown of less than one-fourth peculiar species of
  mammalia and fully one-fourth peculiar species of land-birds, teaches us
  that the possession of the power of flight affects but little the
  distribution of <!-- Page 381 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page381"></a>{381}</span>land-animals, and gives us confidence in
  the results we may arrive at in those cases where we have, from whatever
  cause, to depend on a knowledge of the birds alone. And if we consider
  the wide range of certain groups of powerful flight&mdash;as the birds of
  prey, the swallows and swifts, the king-crows, and some others, we shall
  be forced to conclude that the majority of forest-birds are restricted by
  even narrow watery barriers, to an even greater extent than mammalia.</p>

  <p><i>The Affinities of the Bornean Fauna.</i>&mdash;The animals of
  Borneo exhibit an almost perfect identity in general character, and a
  close similarity in species, with those of Sumatra and the Malay
  Peninsula. So great is this resemblance that it is a question whether it
  might not be quite as great were the whole united; for the extreme points
  of Borneo and Sumatra are 1,500 miles apart&mdash;as far as from Madrid
  to Constantinople, or from the Missouri valley to California. In such an
  extent of country we always meet with some local species, and
  representative forms, so that we hardly require any great lapse of time
  as an element in the production of the peculiarities we actually find. So
  far as the forms of life are concerned, Borneo, as an island, may be no
  older than Great Britain; for the time that has elapsed since the glacial
  epoch would be amply sufficient to produce such a redistribution of the
  species, consequent on their mutual relations being disturbed, as would
  bring the islands into their present zoological condition. There are,
  however, other facts to be considered, which seem to imply much greater
  and more complex revolutions than the recent separation of Borneo from
  Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, and that these changes must have been
  spread over a considerable lapse of time. In order to understand what
  these changes probably were, we must give a brief sketch of the fauna of
  Java, the peculiarities of which introduce a new element into the
  question we have to discuss. <!-- Page 382 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page382"></a>{382}</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Java.</span></p>

  <p>The rich and beautiful island of Java, interesting alike to the
  politician, the geographer, and the naturalist, is more especially
  attractive to the student of geographical distribution, because it
  furnishes him with some of the most curious anomalies and difficult
  problems in a place where such would be least expected. As Java forms
  with Sumatra one almost unbroken line of volcanoes and volcanic
  mountains, interrupted only by the narrow Straits of Sunda, we should
  naturally expect a close resemblance between the productions of the two
  islands. But in point of fact there is a much greater difference between
  them than between Sumatra and Borneo, so much further apart, and so very
  unlike in physical features.<a name="NtA_142"
  href="#Nt_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> Java differs from the three great
  land masses&mdash;Borneo, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula, far more than
  either of these do from each other; and this is the first anomaly we
  encounter. But a more serious difficulty than this remains to be stated.
  Java has certain close resemblances to the Siamese Peninsula, and also to
  the Himalayas, which Borneo and Sumatra do not exhibit to so great a
  proportionate extent; and looking at the relative position of these lands
  respectively, this seems most incomprehensible. In order fully to
  appreciate the singularity and difficulty of the problem, it will be
  necessary to point out the exact nature and amount of these peculiarities
  in the fauna of Java.</p>

  <p><i>General Character of the Fauna of Java.</i>&mdash;If we were only
  to take account of the number of peculiar species in Java, and the
  relations of its fauna generally to that of the surrounding lands, we
  might pass it over as a less interesting island than Borneo or Sumatra.
  Its mammalia (ninety species) are nearly as numerous as those of Borneo,
  but are apparently less peculiar, none of the genera and only five or six
  of the species being confined to the island. In land-birds it is
  decidedly less rich, having only 300 species, of which about forty-five
  are peculiar, and only one <!-- Page 383 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page383"></a>{383}</span>or two belong to peculiar genera; so that
  here again the amount of speciality is considerably less than in Borneo.
  It is only when we proceed to analyse the species of the Javan fauna, and
  trace their distribution and affinities, that we discover its interesting
  nature.</p>

  <p><i>Difference Between the Fauna of Java and that of the other great
  Malay Islands.</i>&mdash;Comparing the fauna of Java with that which may
  be called the typical Malayan fauna as exhibited in Borneo, Sumatra, and
  the Malay Peninsula, we find the following differences. No less than
  thirteen genera of mammalia, each of which is known to inhabit at least
  two, and generally all three, of the above-named Malayan countries, are
  totally absent from Java; and they include such important forms as the
  elephant, the tapir, and the Malay bear. It cannot be said that this
  difference depends on imperfect knowledge, for Java is one of the oldest
  European settlements in the East, and has been explored by a long
  succession of Dutch and English naturalists. Every part of it is
  thoroughly well known, and it would be almost as difficult to find a new
  mammal of any size in Europe as in Java. Of birds there are twenty-five
  genera, all typically Malayan and occurring at least in two, and for the
  most part in all three of the Malay countries, which are yet absent from
  Java. Most of these are large and conspicuous forms, such as jays,
  gapers, bee-eaters, woodpeckers, hornbills, cuckoos, parrots, pheasants,
  and partridges, as impossible to have remained undiscovered in Java as
  the large mammalia above referred to.</p>

  <p>Besides these absent <i>genera</i> there are some curious
  illustrations of Javan isolation in the <i>species</i>; there being
  several cases in which the same species occurs in all three of the
  typical Malay countries, while in Java it is represented by an allied
  species. These occur chiefly among birds, there being no less than seven
  species which are common to the three great Malay countries but are
  represented in Java by distinct though closely allied species.</p>

  <p>From these facts it is impossible to doubt that Java has had a history
  of its own, quite distinct from that of the other portions of the Malayan
  area. <!-- Page 384 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page384"></a>{384}</span></p>

  <p><i>Special Relations of the Javan Fauna to that of the Asiatic
  Continent.</i>&mdash;These relations are indicated by comparatively few
  examples, but they are very clear and of great importance. Among
  mammalia, the genus Helictis is found in Java but in no other Malay
  country, though it inhabits also North India; while two species,
  <i>Rhinoceros javanicus</i> and <i>Lepus kurgosa</i>, are natives of
  Indo-Chinese countries and Java, but not of typical Malaya. In birds
  there are five genera or sub-genera&mdash;Zoothera, Notodela,
  Crypsirhina, Allotrius, and Cochoa, which inhabit Java, the Himalayas,
  and Indo-China, all but the last extending south to Tenasserim, but none
  of them occurring in Malacca, Sumatra, or Borneo. There are also two
  species of birds&mdash;a trogon (<i>Harpactes oreskios</i>), and the
  Javanese peacock (<i>Pavo muticus</i>), which inhabit only Java and the
  Indo-Chinese countries, the former reaching Tenasserim and the latter
  Perak in the Malay Peninsula.</p>

  <p>Here, then, we find a series of remarkable similarities between Java
  and the Asiatic continent, quite independent of the typical Malay
  countries&mdash;Borneo, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula, which latter
  have evidently formed one connected land, and thus appear to preclude any
  independent union of Java and Siam.</p>

  <p>The great difficulty in explaining these facts is, that all the
  required changes of sea and land must have occurred within the period of
  existing species of mammalia. Sumatra, Borneo, and Malacca have, as we
  have seen, a great similarity as regards their species of mammals and
  birds, while Java, though it differs from them in so curious a manner,
  has no greater degree of speciality, since its species, when not Malayan,
  are almost all North Indian or Siamese.</p>

  <p>There is, however, one consideration which may help us over this
  difficulty. It seems highly probable that in the equatorial regions
  species have changed less rapidly than in the north temperate zone, on
  account of the equality and stability of the equatorial climate. We have
  seen, in Chapter X., how important an agent in producing extinction and
  modification of species must have been the repeated changes from cold to
  warm, and from warm to cold <!-- Page 385 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page385"></a>{385}</span>conditions, with the migrations and
  crowding together that must have been their necessary consequence. But in
  the lowlands, near the equator, these changes would be very little if at
  all felt, and thus one great cause of specific modification would be
  wanting. Let us now see whether we can sketch out a series of not
  improbable changes which may have brought about the existing relations of
  Java and Borneo to the continent.</p>

  <p><i>Past Geographical Changes of Java and Borneo.</i>&mdash;Although
  Java and Sumatra are mainly volcanic, they are by no means wholly so.
  Sumatra possesses in its great mountain masses ancient crystalline rocks
  with much granite, while there are extensive Tertiary deposits of Eocene
  age, overlying which are numerous beds of coal now raised up many
  thousand feet above the sea.<a name="NtA_143"
  href="#Nt_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> The volcanoes appear to have burst
  through these older mountains, and to have partly covered them as well as
  great areas of the lowlands with the products of their eruptions. In Java
  either the fundamental strata were less extensive and less raised above
  the sea, or the period of volcanic action has been of longer duration;
  for here no crystalline rocks have been found except a few boulders of
  granite in the western part of the island, perhaps the relics of a
  formation destroyed by denudation or covered up by volcanic deposits. In
  the southern part of Java, however, there is an extensive range of low
  mountains, about 3,000 feet high, consisting of basalt with limestone,
  apparently of Miocene age.</p>

  <p>During this last named period, then, Java would have been at least
  3,000 feet lower than it is now, and such a depression would probably
  extend to considerable parts of Sumatra and Borneo, so as to reduce them
  all to a few small islands. At some later period a gradual elevation
  occurred, which ultimately united the whole of the islands with the
  continent. This may have continued till the glacial period of the
  northern hemisphere, during the severest part of which a few Himalayan
  species of birds and mammals may have been driven southward, and <!--
  Page 386 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page386"></a>{386}</span>have
  ranged over suitable portions of the whole area. Java then became
  separated by subsidence, and these species were imprisoned in the island;
  while those in the remaining part of the Malayan area again migrated
  northward when the cold had passed away from their former home, the
  equatorial forests of Borneo, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula being more
  especially adapted to the typical Malayan fauna which is there developed
  in rich profusion. A little later the subsidence may have extended
  farther north, isolating Borneo and Sumatra, in which a few other Indian
  or Indo-Chinese forms have been retained, but probably leaving the Malay
  Peninsula as a ridge between them as far as the islands of Banca and
  Biliton. Other slight changes of climate followed, when a further
  subsidence separated these last-named islands from the Malay Peninsula,
  and left them with two or three species which have since become slightly
  modified. We may thus explain how it is that a species is sometimes
  common to Sumatra and Borneo, while the intervening island (Banca)
  possesses a distinct form.<a name="NtA_144"
  href="#Nt_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In my <i>Geographical Distribution of Animals</i>, Vol. I., p. 357, I
  have given a somewhat different hypothetical explanation of the relations
  of Java and Borneo to the continent, in which I took account of changes
  of land and sea only; but a fuller consideration of the influence of
  changes of climate on the migration of animals, has led me to the much
  simpler, and, I think, more probable, explanation above given. The amount
  of the relationship between Java and Siam, as well as of that between
  Java and the Himalayas, is too small to be well accounted for by an
  independent geographical connection in which Borneo and Sumatra did not
  take part. It is, at the same time, too distinct and indisputable to be
  ignored; and a change of climate which should drive a portion of the
  Himalayan fauna southward, leaving a few species in Java and Borneo from
  which they could not return owing to the subsequent isolation of those
  islands by subsidence, seems <!-- Page 387 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page387"></a>{387}</span>to be a cause exactly adapted to produce
  the kind and amount of affinity between these distant countries that
  actually exists.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">The Philippine Islands.</span></p>

  <p>A general account of the fauna of these islands, and of their
  biological relations to the countries which form the subject of this
  chapter, has been given in my <i>Geographical Distribution of
  Animals</i>, Vol. I. pp. 345-349; but since the publication of that work
  considerable additions have been made to their fauna, having the effect
  of somewhat diminishing their isolation from the other islands. Four
  genera have been added to the terrestrial mammalia&mdash;Crocidura,
  Felis, Pteromys, and Mus, as well as two additional squirrels; while the
  black ape (<i>Cynopithecus niger</i>) has been struck out as not
  inhabiting the Philippines. This brings the true land mammalia to
  twenty-one species, of which fourteen are peculiar to the islands; but to
  these we must add no less than thirty-three species of bats of which only
  ten are peculiar.<a name="NtA_145" href="#Nt_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> In
  these estimates the Palawan <!-- Page 388 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page388"></a>{388}</span>group has been omitted as these islands
  contain so many Bornean species that if included they obscure the special
  features of the fauna.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;The late Marquis of Tweeddale made a special study
  of Philippine birds, and in 1873 published a catalogue in the
  <i>Transactions of the Zoological Society</i> (Vol. IX. Pt. 2, pp.
  125-247). But since that date large collections have been made by
  Everett, Steere, and other travellers, the result of which has been to
  more than double the known species, and to render the ornithological
  fauna an exceedingly rich one. Many of the Malayan genera which were
  thought to be absent when the first edition of this work was published
  have since been discovered, among which are Phyllornis, Criniger, Diceum,
  Prionochilus, and Batrachostomus. But there still remain a large number
  of highly characteristic Malayan genera whose absence gives a distinctive
  feature to the Philippine bird fauna. Among these are Tiga and
  Meiglyptes, genera of woodpeckers; Phænicophaes and Centropus, remarkable
  cuckoos; the long-tailed paroquets, Palæornis; all the genera of Barbets
  except Xantholæma; the small but beautiful family Eurylæmidæ; many genera
  allied to Timalia and Ixos; the mynahs, Gracula; the long-tailed
  flycatchers, Tchitrea; the fire-backed pheasants, Euplocamus; the argus
  pheasants, the jungle-fowl, and many others.</p>

  <p>The following tabular statement will illustrate the rapid growth of
  our knowledge of the birds of the Philippines:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The number of peculiar species is very large, there being about 300
  land and forty-two water birds, which are not <!-- Page 389 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page389"></a>{389}</span>known to occur beyond
  the group. We have here, still more pronounced than in the case of
  Borneo, the remarkable fact of the true land birds presenting a larger
  amount of speciality than the land mammals; for while more than
  four-fifths of the birds are peculiar, only a little more than half the
  mammals are so, and if we exclude the bats only two-thirds.</p>

  <p>The general character of the fauna of this group of islands is
  evidently the result of their physical conditions and geological history.
  The Philippines are almost surrounded by deep sea, but are connected with
  Borneo by means of two narrow submarine banks, on the northern of which
  is situated Palawan, and on the southern the Sulu Islands. Two small
  groups of islands, the Bashees and Babuyanes, have also afforded a
  partial connection with the continent by way of Formosa. It is evident
  that the Philippines once formed part of the great Malayan extension of
  Asia, but that they were separated considerably earlier than Java; and
  having been since greatly isolated and much broken up by volcanic
  disturbances, their species have for the most part become modified into
  distinct local forms, representative species often occurring in the
  different islands of the group. They have also received a few Chinese
  types by the route already indicated, and a few Australian forms owing to
  their proximity to the Moluccas. Their comparative poverty in genera and
  species of the mammalia is perhaps due to the fact that they have been
  subjected to a great amount of submersion in recent times, greatly
  reducing their area and causing the extinction of a considerable portion
  of their fauna. This is not a mere hypothesis, but is supported by direct
  evidence; for I am informed by Mr. Everett, who has made extensive
  explorations in the islands, that almost everywhere are found large
  tracts of elevated coral-reefs, containing shells similar to those living
  in the adjacent seas, an indisputable proof of recent elevation.</p>

  <p><i>Concluding Remarks on the Malay Islands.</i>&mdash;This completes
  our sketch of the great Malay islands, the seat of the typical Malayan
  fauna. It has been shown that the peculiarities presented by the
  individual islands may be all <!-- Page 390 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page390"></a>{390}</span>sufficiently well explained by a very
  simple and comparatively unimportant series of geographical changes,
  combined with a limited amount of change of climate towards the northern
  tropic. Beginning in late Miocene times when the deposits on the south
  coast of Java were upraised, we suppose a general elevation of the whole
  of the extremely shallow seas uniting what are now Sumatra, Java, Borneo,
  and the Philippines with the Asiatic continent, and forming that extended
  equatorial area in which the typical Malayan fauna was developed. After a
  long period of stability, giving ample time for the specialisation of so
  many peculiar types, the Philippines were first separated; then at a
  considerably later period Java; a little later Sumatra and Borneo; and
  finally the islands south of Singapore to Banca and Biliton. This one
  simple series of elevations and subsidences, combined with the changes of
  climate already referred to, and such local elevations and depressions as
  must undoubtedly have occurred, appears sufficient to have brought about
  the curious, and at first sight puzzling, relations, of the faunas of
  Java and the Philippines, as compared with those of the larger
  islands.</p>

  <p>We will now pass on to the consideration of two other groups which
  offer features of special interest, and which will complete our
  illustrative survey of recent continental islands.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Japan.</span></p>

  <p>The Japanese Islands occupy a very similar position on the eastern
  shore of the great Euro-Asiatic continent to that of the British Islands
  on the western, except that they are about sixteen degrees further south,
  and having a greater extension in latitude enjoy a more varied as well as
  a more temperate climate. Their outline is also much more irregular and
  their mountains loftier, the volcanic peak of Fusiyama being 14,177 feet
  high; while their geological structure is very complex, their soil
  extremely fertile, and their vegetation in the highest degree varied and
  beautiful. Like our own islands, too, they are connected with the
  continent by a marine bank less than a hundred fathoms below the
  surface&mdash;at all events towards the north and south; but in the
  intervening space the Sea of Japan opens out to a width of six hundred
  miles, and in its central portion is very deep, and this may be an
  indication that the connection between the islands and the continent is
  of rather ancient date. At the Straits of Corea the distance from the
  main land is about 120 miles, while at the northern extremity of Yesso it
  is about 200. The island of Saghalien, however, separated from Yesso by a
  strait only twenty-five miles wide, forms a connection with Amoorland in
  about 52° N. Lat. A southern warm current flowing a little to the
  eastward of the islands, ameliorates their climate much in the same way
  as the Gulf Stream does ours, and added to their insular position enables
  them to support a more tropical vegetation and more varied forms of life
  than are found at corresponding latitudes in China.</p>

  <p><i>Zoological Features of Japan.</i>&mdash;As we might expect from the
  conditions here sketched out, Japan exhibits in all its forms of animal
  life a close general resemblance to the adjacent continent, but with a
  considerable element of specific individuality; while it also possesses
  some remarkable isolated groups. Its fauna presents indications of there
  having been two or more lines of migration at different epochs. The
  majority of its animals are related to those of the temperate or cold
  regions of the continent, either as identical or allied species; but a
  smaller number have a tropical character, and these have in several
  instances no allies in China but occur again only in Northern India or
  the Malay Archipelago. There is also a slight American element in the
  fauna of Japan, a relic probably of the period when a land communication
  existed between the two continents over what are now the shallow seas of
  Japan, Ochotsk, and Kamschatka. We will now proceed to examine the
  peculiarities and relations of the fauna.</p>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;The mammalia of Japan at present known are
  forty in number; not very many when compared with the rich fauna of China
  and Manchuria, but containing monkeys, bears, deer, wild goats and wild
  boars, as well as foxes, badgers, moles, squirrels, and hares, so that
  there can be no doubt whatever that they imply a land connection with the
  continent. No complete account of Japan mammals has been given by any
  competent zoologist since the publication of Von Siebold's <i>Fauna
  Japonica</i> in 1844, <!-- Page 394 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page394"></a>{394}</span>but by collecting together most of the
  scattered observations since that period the following list has been
  drawn up, and will, it is hoped, be of use to naturalists. The species
  believed to be peculiar to Japan are printed in italics. These are very
  numerous, but it must be remembered that Corea and Manchuria (the
  portions of the continent opposite Japan) are comparatively little known,
  while in very few cases have the species of Japan and of the continent
  been critically compared. Where this has been done, however, the peculiar
  species established by the older naturalists have been in many cases
  found to be correct.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">List of the Mammalia of the Japanese Islands.</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>1. <i>Macacus speciosus.</i> A monkey with rudimentary tail and red
  face, allied to the Barbary ape. It inhabits the island of Niphon up to
  41° N. Lat., and has thus the most northern range of any living
  monkey.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Pteropus dasymallus.</i> A peculiar fruit-bat, found in Kiusiu
  Island only (Lat. 33° N.), and thus ranging further north of the equator
  than any other species of the genus.</p>

  <p>3. Rhinolophus ferrum-equinum. The great horse-shoe bat, ranges from
  Britain across Europe and temperate Asia to Japan. It is the <i>R.
  nippon</i> of the Fauna Japonica according to Mr. Dobson's <i>Monograph
  of Asiatic Bats</i>.</p>

  <p>4. R. minor. Found also in Burma, Yunan, Java, Borneo, &amp;c.</p>

  Mr. Lord after comparing the two says that he "can find no difference
  whatever, either generic or specific. In shape, size, and colour, they
  are exactly alike." But Dr. Günther (<i>P.&nbsp;Z.&nbsp;S.</i> 1880, p. 441) states
  that <i>U. gibsii</i> differs so much in dentition from the Japanese
  species that it should be placed in a distinct genus, which he calls
  Neurotrichus.</p>

  <p>14. Sorex myosurus. A shrew, found also in India and Malaya.</p>

  <p>15. <i>Sorex dzi-nezumi.</i></p>

  1865, p. 104).</p>

  <p>24. <i>M. Sibericus.</i> Also Siberia and China. This is the <i>M.
  italsi</i> of the Fauna Japonica according to Dr. Gray.</p>

  <p>25. <i>Lutronectes whiteleyi.</i> A new genus and species of otter
  (<i>P.&nbsp;Z.&nbsp;S.</i> 1867, p. 180). In the Fauna Japonica named <i>Lutra
  vulgaris</i>.</p>

  <p>33. <i>P. momoga.</i> Perhaps identical with a Cambojan species
  (<i>P.&nbsp;Z.&nbsp;S.</i> 1861, p. 137).</p>

  <p>34. <i>Myoxus japonicus.</i> A peculiar dormouse. <i>M. elegans</i> of

</blockquote>

  <p>We thus find that no less than twenty-six out of the forty-one
  Japanese mammals are peculiar, and if we omit the aërial bats (nine in
  number), as well as the marine sea-otter, we shall have remaining only
  thirty strictly land mammalia, of which twenty-five are peculiar, or
  five-sixths of the whole. Nor does this represent all their speciality;
  for we have a mole differing in its dentition from the European mole;
  another superficially resembling but quite distinct from an American
  species; a peculiar genus of otters; and an antelope whose nearest allies
  are in Formosa and Sumatra. The importance of these facts will <!-- Page
  396 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page396"></a>{396}</span>be best
  understood when we have examined the corresponding affinities of the
  birds of Japan.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;Owing to the recent researches of some English
  residents we have probably a fuller knowledge of the birds than of the
  mammalia; yet the number of true land-birds ascertained to inhabit the
  islands either as residents or migrants is only 200, which is less than
  might be expected considering the highly favourable conditions of mild
  climate, luxuriant vegetation, and abundance of insect-life, and the
  extreme riches of the adjacent continent,&mdash;Mr. Swinhoe's list of the
  birds of China containing more than 400 land species, after deducting all
  which are peculiar to the adjacent islands. Only seventeen species, or
  about one-twelfth of the whole, are now considered to be peculiar to
  Japan proper; while seventeen more are peculiar to the various outlying
  small islands constituting the Bonin and Loo Choo groups. Even of these,
  six or seven are classed by Mr. Seebohm as probably sub-species or
  slightly modified forms of continental birds, so that ten only are
  well-marked species, undoubtedly distinct from those of any other
  country.</p>

  <p>The great majority of the birds are decidedly temperate forms
  identical with those of Northern Asia and Europe; while no less than
  forty of the species of land-birds are also found in Britain, or are such
  slight modifications of British species that the difference is only
  perceptible to a trained ornithologist. The following list of the
  land-birds common to Britain and Japan is very interesting, when we
  consider that these countries are separated by the whole extent of the
  European and Asiatic continents, or by almost exactly one-fourth of the
  circumference of the globe:&mdash;</p>

  for there are also thrushes, robins, stonechats, wrens, hedge-sparrows,
  sedge-warblers, jays, starlings, swifts, goatsuckers, and some others,
  which, though distinct <i>species</i> from our own, have the same general
  appearance, and give a familiar aspect to the ornithology. There remains,
  however, a considerable body of Chinese and Siberian species, which link
  the islands to the neighbouring parts of the continent; and there are
  also a few which are Malayan or Himalayan rather than Chinese, and thus
  afford us an interesting problem in distribution.</p>

  <p>The seventeen species and sub-species which are altogether peculiar to
  Japan proper, are for the most part allied to birds of North China and
  Siberia, but three are decidedly tropical, and one of them&mdash;a fruit
  pigeon (<i>Treron sieboldi</i>)&mdash;has no close ally nearer than
  Burmah and the Himalayas. In the following list the affinities of the

  <p>The large number of seventeen peculiar species in the outlying Bonin
  and Loo Choo Islands is an interesting feature of Japanese ornithology.
  The comparative remoteness of <!-- Page 399 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page399"></a>{399}</span>these islands, their mild sub-tropical
  climate and luxuriant vegetation, and perhaps the absence of violent
  storms and their being situated out of the line of continental migration,
  seem to be the conditions that have favoured the specialisation of
  modified types adapted to the new environment.</p>

  <p><i>Japan Birds Recurring in Distant Areas.</i>&mdash;The most
  interesting feature in the ornithology of Japan is, undoubtedly, the
  presence of several species which indicate an alliance with such remote
  districts as the Himalayas, the Malay Islands, and Europe. Among the
  peculiar species, the most remarkable of this class are,&mdash;the
  fruit-pigeon of the genus Treron, entirely unknown in China, but
  reappearing in Formosa and Japan; the Hypsipetes, whose nearest ally is
  in South China at a distance of nearly 500 miles; and the jay
  (<i>Garrulus japonicus</i>), whose near ally (<i>G. glandarius</i>)
  inhabits Europe only, at a distance of 3,700 miles. But even more
  extraordinary are the following non-peculiar species:&mdash;<i>Spizaetus
  orientalis</i>, a crested eagle, inhabiting the Himalayas, Formosa, and
  Japan, but unknown in Southern or Eastern China; <i>Ceryle guttata</i>, a
  spotted kingfisher, almost confined to the Himalayas and Japan, though
  occurring rarely in Central China; and <i>Halcyon coromanda</i>, a
  brilliant red kingfisher inhabiting Northern India, the Malay Islands to
  Celebes, Formosa, and Japan. We have here an excellent illustration of
  the favourable conditions which islands afford both for species which
  elsewhere live further south (<i>Halcyon coromanda</i>), and for the
  preservation in isolated colonies of species which are verging towards
  extinction; for such we must consider the above-named eagle and
  kingfisher, both confined to a very limited area on the continent, but
  surviving in remote islands. Referring to our account of the birth,
  growth, and death of a species (in Chapter IV.) it can hardly be doubted
  that the <i>Ceryle guttata</i> formerly ranged from the Himalayas to
  Japan, and has now almost died out in the intervening area owing to
  geographical and physical changes, a subject which will be better
  discussed when we have examined the interesting fauna of the island of
  Formosa. <!-- Page 400 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page400"></a>{400}</span></p>

  <p>The other orders of animals are not yet sufficiently known to enable
  us to found any accurate conclusions upon them. The main facts of their
  distribution have already been given in my <i>Geographical Distribution
  of Animals</i> (Vol I., pp. 227-231), and they sufficiently agree with
  the birds and mammalia in showing a mixture of temperate and tropical
  forms with a considerable proportion of peculiar species. Owing to the
  comparatively easy passage from the northern extremity of Japan through
  the island of Saghalien to the mainland of Asia, a large number of
  temperate forms of insects and birds are still able to enter the country,
  and thus diminish the proportionate number of peculiar species. In the
  case of mammals this is more difficult; and the large proportion of
  specific difference in their case is a good indication of the
  comparatively remote epoch at which Japan was finally separated from the
  continent. How long ago this separation took place we cannot of course
  tell, but we may be sure it was much longer than in the case of our own
  islands, and therefore probably in the earlier portion of the Pliocene
  period.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Formosa.</span></p>

  <p>Among recent continental islands there is probably none that surpasses
  in interest and instructiveness the Chinese island named by the
  Portuguese, Formosa, or "The Beautiful." Till quite recently it was a
  <i>terra incognita</i> to naturalists, and we owe almost all our present
  knowledge of it to a single man, the late Mr. Robert Swinhoe, who, in his
  official capacity as one of our consuls in China, visited it several
  times between 1856 and 1866, besides residing on it for more than a year.
  During this period he devoted all his spare time and energy to the study
  of natural history, more especially of the two important groups, birds
  and mammals; and by employing a large staff of native collectors and
  hunters, he obtained a very complete knowledge of its fauna. In this
  case, too, we have the great advantage of a very thorough knowledge of
  the adjacent parts of the continent, in great part due to Mr. Swinhoe's
  own exertions during the twenty years of his service in <!-- Page 401
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page401"></a>{401}</span>that country.
  We possess, too, the further advantage of having the whole of the
  available materials in these two classes collected together by Mr.
  Swinhoe himself after full examination and comparison of specimens; so
  that there is probably no part of the world (if we except Europe, North
  America, and British India) of whose warm-blooded vertebrates we possess
  fuller or more accurate knowledge than we do of those of the coast
  districts of China and its islands.<a name="NtA_147"
  href="#Nt_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Physical Features of Formosa.</i>&mdash;The island of Formosa is
  nearly half the size of Ireland, being 220 miles long, and from twenty to
  eighty miles wide. It is traversed down its centre by a fine mountain
  range, which reaches an altitude of about 8,000 feet in the south and
  12,000 feet in the northern half of the island, and whose higher slopes
  and valleys are everywhere clothed with magnificent forests. It is
  crossed by the line of the Tropic of Cancer a little south of its centre;
  and this position, combined with its lofty mountains, gives it an unusual
  variety of tropical and temperate climates. These circumstances are all
  highly favourable to the preservation and development of animal life, and
  from what we already know of its productions, it seems probable that few,
  if any islands of approximately the same size and equally removed from a
  continent will be found to equal it in the number and variety of their
  higher animals. The outline map (at page <a href="#page392">392</a>)
  shows that Formosa is connected with the mainland by a submerged bank,
  the hundred-fathom line including it along with Hainan to the south-west
  and Japan on the north-east; while the line of two-hundred fathoms
  includes also the Madjico-Sima and Loo-Choo Islands, and may, perhaps,
  mark out approximately the last great extension of the Asiatic continent,
  the submergence of which isolated these islands from the mainland.</p>

  <p><i>Animal Life of Formosa.</i>&mdash;We are at present acquainted <!--
  Page 402 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page402"></a>{402}</span>with
  35 species of mammalia, and 128 species of land-birds from Formosa,
  fourteen of the former and forty-three of the latter being peculiar,
  while the remainder inhabit also some part of the continent or adjacent
  islands. This proportion of peculiar species is perhaps (as regards the
  birds) the highest to be met with in any island which can be classed as
  both continental and recent, and this, in all probability, implies that
  the epoch of separation is somewhat remote. It was not, however, remote
  enough to reach back to a time when the continental fauna was very
  different from what it is now, for we find all the chief types of living
  Asiatic mammalia represented in this small island. Thus we have monkeys;
  insectivora; numerous carnivora; pigs, deer, antelopes, and cattle among
  ungulata; numerous rodents, and the edentate Manis,&mdash;a very fair
  representation of Asiatic mammals, all being of known genera, and of
  species either absolutely identical with some still living elsewhere or
  very closely allied to them. The birds exhibit analogous phenomena, with
  the exception that we have here two peculiar and very interesting
  genera.</p>

  <p>But besides the amount of specific and generic modification that has
  occurred, we have another indication of the lapse of time in the peculiar
  relations of a large proportion of the Formosan animals, which show that
  a great change in the distribution of Asiatic species must have taken
  place since the separation of the island from the continent. Before
  pointing these out it will be advantageous to give lists of the mammalia
  and peculiar birds of the island, as we shall have frequent occasion to
  refer to them.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The most interesting and suggestive feature connected with these
  Formosan mammals is the identity or affinity of several of them, with
  Indian or Malayan rather than with Chinese species. We have the
  rock-monkey of Formosa allied to the rhesus monkeys of India and Burma,
  not to those of South China and Hainan. The tree civet (<i>Helictis
  subaurantiaca</i>), and the small flying squirrel (<i>Sciuropterus
  kaleensis</i>), are both allied to Himalayan species. Swinhoe's deer and
  goat-antelope are nearest to Malayan species, as are the red and
  white-breasted flying squirrels; while the fruit-bat, the wild pig, <!--
  Page 404 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page404"></a>{404}</span>and
  the spotted deer are all allied to peculiar Japanese species. The clouded
  tiger is a Malay species unknown in China, while the Asiatic wild cat is
  a native of the Himalayas and Malacca. It is clear, therefore, that
  before Formosa was separated from the mainland the above named animals or
  their ancestral types must have ranged over the intervening country as
  far as the Himalayas on the west, Japan on the north, and Borneo or the
  Philippines on the south; and that after that event occurred, the
  conditions were so materially changed as to lead to the extinction of
  these species in what are now the coast provinces of China, while they or
  their modified descendants continued to exist in the dense forests of the
  Himalayas and the Malay Islands, and in such detached islands as Formosa
  and Japan. We will now see what additional light is thrown upon this
  subject by an examination of the birds.</p>

  <p>This list exhibits to us the marvellous fact that more than half the
  peculiar species of Formosan birds have their nearest allies in such
  remote regions as the Himalayas, South India, the Malay Islands, or
  Japan, rather than in the adjacent parts of the Asiatic continent.
  Fourteen species have Himalayan allies, and six of these belong to genera
  which are unknown in China. One has its nearest ally in the Nilgherries,
  and five in the Malay Islands; and of these six, four belong to genera
  which are not Chinese. Two have their only near allies in Japan. Perhaps
  more curious still are those cases in which, though the genus is Chinese,
  the nearest allied species is to be sought for in some remote region.
  Thus we have the Formosan babbler (<i>Garrulax ruficeps</i>) not allied
  to the species found in South China, but to one inhabiting North India
  and East Thibet; while the black bulbul (<i>Hypsipetes nigerrimus</i>),
  is not allied to the Chinese species but to an Assamese form.</p>

  <p>In the same category as the above we must place eight species not
  peculiar to Formosa, but which are Indian or Malayan rather than Chinese,
  so that they offer examples of discontinuous distribution somewhat
  analogous to what <!-- Page 407 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page407"></a>{407}</span>we found to occur in Japan. These are
  enumerated in the following list.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Species of Birds common to Formosa and India or Malaya, but not found in China.</span></p>

  <p>1. <i>Siphia superciliaris.</i> The Rufous-breasted Flycatcher of the
  S.&nbsp;E. Himalayas.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Halcyon coromanda.</i> The Great Red Kingfisher of India,
  Malaya, and Japan.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Palumbus pulchricollis.</i> The Darjeeling Wood-pigeon of the
  S.&nbsp;E. Himalayas.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Turnix dussumieri.</i> The larger Button-quail of India.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Spizaetus nipalensis.</i> The Spotted Hawk-eagle of Nepal and
  Assam.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Lophospiza trivirgata.</i> The Crested Gos-hawk of the Malay
  Islands.</p>

  <p>7. <i>Bulaca newarensis.</i> The Brown Wood-owl of the Himalayas.</p>

  <p>8. <i>Strix candida.</i> The Grass-owl of India and Malaya.</p>

  <p>The most interesting of the above are the pigeon and the flycatcher,
  both of which are, so far as yet known, strictly confined to the
  Himalayan mountains and Formosa. They thus afford examples of
  discontinuous specific distribution exactly parallel to that of the great
  spotted kingfisher, already referred to as found only in the Himalayas
  and Japan.</p>

  <p><i>Comparison of the Faunas of Hainan, Formosa, and
  Japan.</i>&mdash;The island of Hainan on the extreme south of China, and
  only separated from the mainland by a strait fifteen miles wide, appears
  to have considerable similarity to Formosa, inasmuch as it possesses
  seventeen peculiar land-birds (out of 130 obtained by Mr. Swinhoe), two
  of which are close allies of Formosan species, while two others are
  identical. We also find four species whose nearest allies are in the
  Himalayas. Our knowledge of this island and of the adjacent coast of
  China is not yet sufficient to enable us to form an accurate judgment of
  its relations, but it seems probable that it was separated from the
  continent at, approximately, the same epoch as Formosa and Japan, and
  that the special features of each of these islands are mainly due to
  their geographical position. Formosa, being more completely isolated than
  either of the others, possesses a larger proportion of peculiar species
  of birds, while its tropical situation and lofty mountain ranges <!--
  Page 408 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page408"></a>{408}</span>have
  enabled it to preserve an unusual number of Himalayan and Malayan forms.
  Japan, almost equally isolated towards the south, and having a much
  greater variety of climate as well as a much larger area, possesses about
  an equal number of mammalia with Formosa, and an even larger proportion
  of peculiar species. Its birds, however, though more numerous are less
  peculiar; and this is probably due to the large number of species which
  migrate northwards in summer, and find it easy to enter Japan through the
  Kurile Isles or Saghalien.<a name="NtA_148"
  href="#Nt_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a> Japan too, is largely peopled by
  those northern types which have an unusually wide range, and which, being
  almost all migratory, are accustomed to cross over seas of moderate
  extent. The regular or occasional influx of these species prevents the
  formation of special insular races, such as are almost always produced
  when a portion of the population of a species remains for a considerable
  time completely isolated. We thus have explained the curious fact, that
  while the mammalia of the two islands are almost equally peculiar, (those
  of Japan being most so in the present state of our knowledge), the birds
  of Formosa show a far greater number of peculiar species than those of
  Japan.</p>

  <p><i>General Remarks on Recent Continental Islands.</i>&mdash;We have
  now briefly sketched the zoological peculiarities of an illustrative
  series of recent continental islands, commencing with one of the most
  recent&mdash;Great Britain&mdash;in which the process of formation of
  peculiar species has only just commenced, and terminating with Formosa,
  probably one of the most ancient of the series, and which accordingly
  presents us with a very large proportion of peculiar species, not only in
  its mammalia, which have no means of crossing the wide strait which
  separates it from the mainland, but also in its birds, many of which are
  quite able to cross over.</p>

  <p>Here, too, we obtain a glimpse of the way in which <!-- Page 409
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page409"></a>{409}</span>species die
  out and are replaced by others, which quite agrees with what the theory
  of evolution assures us must have occurred. On a continent, the process
  of extinction will generally take effect on the circumference of the area
  of distribution, because it is there that the species comes into contact
  with such adverse conditions or competing forms as prevent it from
  advancing further. A very slight change will evidently turn the scale and
  cause the species to contract its range, and this usually goes on till it
  is reduced to a very restricted area, and finally becomes extinct. It may
  conceivably happen (and almost certainly has sometimes happened) that the
  process of restriction of range by adverse conditions may act in one
  direction only, and over a limited district, so as ultimately to divide
  the specific area into two separated parts, in each of which a portion of
  the species will continue to maintain itself. We have seen that there is
  reason to believe that this has occurred in a very few cases both in
  North America and in Northern Asia. (<i>See</i> pp. <a
  href="#page65">65</a>-<a href="#page68">68</a>.) But the same thing has
  certainly occurred in a considerable number of cases, only it has
  resulted in the divided areas being occupied by <i>representative
  forms</i> instead of by the very same species. The cause of this is very
  easy to understand. We have already shown that there is a large amount of
  local variation in a considerable number of species, and we may be sure
  that were it not for the constant intermingling and intercrossing of the
  individuals inhabiting adjacent localities this tendency to local
  variation in adaptation to slightly different conditions, would soon form
  distinct races. But as soon as the area is divided into two portions the
  intercrossing is stopped, and the usual result is that two closely allied
  races, classed as representative species, become formed. Such pairs of
  allied species on the two sides of a continent, or in two detached areas,
  are very numerous; and their existence is only explicable on the
  supposition that they are descendants of a parent form which once
  occupied an area comprising that of both of them,&mdash;that this area
  then became discontinuous,&mdash;and, lastly, that, as a consequence of
  the discontinuity, the two sections of the parent species became
  segregated into distinct races or new species. <!-- Page 410 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page410"></a>{410}</span></p>

  <p>Now, when the division of the area leaves one portion of the species
  in an island, a similar modification of the species, either in the island
  or in the continent, occurs, resulting in closely-allied but distinct
  forms; and such forms are, as we have seen, highly characteristic of
  island-faunas. But islands also favour the occasional preservation of the
  unchanged species&mdash;a phenomenon which very rarely occurs in
  continents. This is probably due to the absence of competition in
  islands, so that the parent species there maintains itself unchanged,
  while the continental portion, by the force of that competition, is
  driven back to some remote mountain area, where it also obtains a
  comparative freedom from competition. Thus may be explained the curious
  fact, that the species common to Formosa and India are generally confined
  to limited areas in the Himalayas, or in other cases are found only in
  remote islands, as Japan or Hainan.</p>

  <p>The distribution and affinities of the animals of continental islands
  thus throws much light on that obscure subject&mdash;the decay and
  extinction of species; while the numerous and delicate gradations in the
  modification of the continental species, from perfect identity, through
  slight varieties, local forms, and insular races, to well-defined species
  and even distinct genera, afford an overwhelming mass of evidence in
  favour of the theory of "descent with modification."</p>

  <p>We shall now pass on to another class of islands, which, though
  originally forming parts of continents, were separated from them at very
  remote epochs. This antiquity is clearly manifested in their existing
  faunas, which present many peculiarities, and offer some most curious
  problems to the student of distribution.</p>

  <p>We have now to consider the phenomena presented by a very distinct
  class of islands&mdash;those which, although once forming part of a
  continent, have been separated from it at a remote epoch when its animal
  forms were very unlike what they are now. Such islands preserve to us the
  record of a by-gone world,&mdash;of a period when many of the higher
  types had not yet come into existence and when the distribution of others
  was very different from what prevails at the present day. The problem
  presented by these ancient islands is often complicated by the changes
  they themselves have undergone since the period of their separation. A
  partial subsidence will have led to the <!-- Page 412 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page412"></a>{412}</span>extinction of some of
  the types that were originally preserved, and may leave the ancient fauna
  in a very fragmentary state; while subsequent elevations may have brought
  it so near to the continent that some immigration even of mammalia may
  have taken place. If these elevations and subsidences occurred several
  times over, though never to such an extent as again to unite the island
  with the continent, it is evident that a very complex result might be
  produced; for besides the relics of the ancient fauna, we might have
  successive immigrations from surrounding lands reaching down to the era
  of existing species. Bearing in mind these possible changes, we shall
  generally be able to arrive at a fair conjectural solution of the
  phenomena of distribution presented by these ancient islands.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly the most interesting of such islands, and that which
  exhibits their chief peculiarities in the greatest perfection, is
  Madagascar, and we shall therefore enter somewhat fully into its
  biological and physical history.</p>

  <p><i>Physical Features of Madagascar.</i>&mdash;This great island is
  situated about 250 miles from the east coast of Africa, and extends from
  12° to 25½° S. Lat. It is almost exactly 1,000 miles long, with an
  extreme width of 360 and an average width of more than 260 miles. A lofty
  granitic plateau, from eighty to 160 miles wide and from 3,000 to 5,000
  feet high, occupies its central portion, on which rise peaks and domes of
  basalt and granite to a height of nearly 9,000 feet; and there are also
  numerous extinct volcanic cones and craters. All round the island, but
  especially developed on the south and west, are plains of a few hundred
  feet elevation, formed of rocks which are shown by their fossils to be of
  Jurassic age, or at all events to belong to somewhere near the middle
  portion of the Secondary period. The higher granitic plateau consists of
  bare undulating moors, while the lower Secondary plains are more or less
  wooded; and there is here also a continuous belt of dense forest, varying
  from six or eight to fifty miles wide, encircling the whole island,
  usually at about thirty miles distance from the coast but in the
  north-east coming down to the sea-shore. <!-- Page 413 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page413"></a>{413}</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">

  </div>
<p><!-- Page 414 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page414"></a>{414}</span></p>

  <p>The sea around Madagascar, when the shallow bank on which it stands is
  passed, is generally deep. This 100-fathom bank is only from one to three
  miles wide on the east side, but on the west it is much broader, and
  stretches out opposite Mozambique to a distance of about eighty miles.
  The Mozambique Channel is rather more than 1,000 fathoms deep, but there
  is only a narrow belt of this depth opposite Mozambique, and still
  narrower where the Comoro Islands and adjacent shoals seem to form
  stepping-stones to the continent of Africa. The 1,000-fathom line
  includes Aldabra and the small Farquhar Islands to the north of
  Madagascar; while to the east the sea deepens rapidly to the 1,000-fathom
  line and then more slowly, a profound channel of 2,400 fathoms separating
  Madagascar from Bourbon and Mauritius. To the north-east of Mauritius are
  a series of extensive shoals forming four large banks less than 100
  fathoms below the surface, while the 1,000-fathom line includes them all,
  with an area about half that of Madagascar itself. A little further north
  is the Seychelles group, also standing on an extensive 1,000-fathom bank,
  while all round the sea is more than 2,000 fathoms deep.</p>

  <p>It seems probable, then, that to the north-east of Madagascar there
  was once a series of very large islands, separated from it by not very
  wide straits; while eastward across the Indian Ocean we find the Chagos
  and Maldive coral atolls, perhaps marking the position of other large
  islands, which together would form a line of communication, by
  comparatively easy stages of 400 or 500 miles each between Madagascar and
  India. These submerged islands, as shown in our map at p. <a
  href="#page424">424</a>, are of great importance in explaining some
  anomalous features in the zoology of this great island.</p>

  <p>If the rocks of Secondary age which form a belt around the island are
  held to indicate that Madagascar was once of less extent than it is now
  (though this by no means necessarily follows), we have also evidence that
  it has recently been considerably larger; for along the east coast there
  is an extensive barrier coral-reef about 350 miles in length, and varying
  in distance from the land from a quarter of a mile to three or four
  miles. This seems to indicate recent subsidence; while we have no record
  of raised coral rocks inland which would certainly mark any recent
  elevation, though fringing coral reefs surround a considerable portion of
  the northern, eastern, and south-western coasts. We may therefore
  conclude that during Tertiary times the island was usually as large as,
  and often probably much larger than, it is now. <!-- Page 415 --><span

  <p><i>Biological Features of Madagascar.</i>&mdash;Madagascar possesses
  an exceedingly rich and beautiful fauna and flora, rivalling in some
  groups most tropical countries of equal extent, and even when poor in
  species, of surpassing interest from the singularity, the isolation, or
  the beauty of its forms of life. In order to exhibit the full peculiarity
  of its natural history and the nature of the problems it offers to the
  biological student, we must give an outline of its more important animal
  forms in systematic order.</p>

  <p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;Madagascar possesses no less than sixty-six
  species of mammals&mdash;a certain proof in itself that the island has
  once formed part of a continent; but the character of these animals is
  very extraordinary and altogether different from the assemblage now found
  in Africa or in any other existing continent. Africa is now most
  prominently characterised by its monkeys, apes, and baboons; by its
  lions, leopards, and hyænas; by its zebras, rhinoceroses, elephants,
  buffaloes, giraffes, and numerous species of antelopes. But no one of
  these animals, nor any thing like them, is found in Madagascar, and thus
  our first impression would be that it could never have been united with
  the African continent. But, as the tigers, the bears, the tapirs, the
  deer, and the numerous squirrels of Asia are equally absent, there seems
  no probability of its having been united with that continent. Let us then
  see to what groups the mammalia of Madagascar belong, and where we must
  look for their probable allies.</p>

  <p>First and most important are the lemurs, consisting of six genera and
  thirty-three species, thus comprising just half the entire mammalian
  population of the island. This group of lowly-organised and very ancient
  creatures <!-- Page 417 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page417"></a>{417}</span>still exists scattered over a wide area;
  but they are nowhere so abundant as in the island of Madagascar. They are
  found from West Africa to India, Ceylon, and the Malay Archipelago,
  consisting of a number of isolated genera and species, which appear to
  maintain their existence by their nocturnal and arboreal habits, and by
  haunting dense forests. It can hardly be said that the African forms of
  lemurs are more nearly allied to those of Madagascar than are the
  Asiatic, the whole series appearing to be the disconnected fragments of a
  once more compact and extensive group of animals.</p>

  <p>Next, we have about a dozen species of Insectivora, consisting of one
  shrew, a group distributed over all the great continents; and five genera
  of a peculiar family, Centetidæ, which family exists nowhere else on the
  globe except in the two largest West Indian Islands, Cuba and Hayti, thus
  adding still further to our embarrassment in seeking for the original
  home of the Madagascar fauna.</p>

  <p>We then come to the Carnivora, which are represented by a peculiar
  cat-like animal, Cryptoprocta, forming a distinct family, and having no
  close allies in any part of the globe; and eight civets belonging to four
  peculiar genera. Here we first meet with some decided indications of an
  African origin; for the civet family is more abundant in this continent
  than in Asia, and some of the Madagascar genera seem to be decidedly
  allied to African groups&mdash;as, for example, Eupleres to Suricata and
  Crossarchus.<a name="NtA_149" href="#Nt_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Rodents consist only of four rats and mice of peculiar genera, one
  of which is said to be allied to an American genus; and lastly we have a
  river-hog of the African genus Potamochærus, and a small sub-fossil
  hippopotamus, both of which being semi-aquatic animals might easily have
  reached the island from Africa, by way of the Comoros, without any actual
  land connection.<a name="NtA_150" href="#Nt_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Reptiles of Madagascar.</i>&mdash;Passing over the birds for the
  present, as not so clearly demonstrating <!-- Page 418 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page418"></a>{418}</span>land-connection, let us
  see what indications are afforded by the reptiles. The large and
  universally distributed family of Colubrine snakes is represented in
  Madagascar, not by African or Asiatic genera, but by two American
  genera&mdash;Philodryas and Heterodon, and by Herpetodryas, a genus found
  in America and China. The other genera are all peculiar, and belong
  mostly to widespread tropical families; but two
  families&mdash;Lycodontidæ and Viperidæ, both abundant in Africa and the
  Eastern tropics&mdash;are absent. Lizards are mostly represented by
  peculiar genera of African or tropical families, but several African
  genera are represented by peculiar species, and there are also some
  species belonging to two American genera of the Iguanidæ, a family which
  is exclusively American; while a genus of geckoes, inhabiting America and
  Australia, also occurs in Madagascar.</p>

  <p><i>Relation of Madagascar to Africa.</i>&mdash;These facts taken all
  together are certainly very extraordinary, since they show in a
  considerable number of cases as much affinity with America as with
  Africa; while the most striking and characteristic groups of animals now
  inhabiting Africa are entirely wanting in Madagascar. Let us first deal
  with this fact, of the absence of so many of the most dominant African
  groups. The explanation of this deficiency is by no means difficult, for
  the rich deposits of fossil mammals of Miocene or Pliocene age in France,
  Germany, Greece, and North-west India, have demonstrated the fact that
  all the great African mammals then inhabited Europe and temperate Asia.
  We also know that a little earlier (in Eocene times) tropical Africa was
  cut off from Europe and Asia by a sea stretching from the Atlantic to the
  Bay of Bengal, at which time Africa must have formed a detached
  island-continent such as Australia is now, and probably, like it, very
  poor in the higher forms of life. Coupling these two facts, the inference
  seems clear, that all the higher types of mammalia were developed in the
  great Euro-Asiatic continent (which then included Northern Africa), and
  that they only migrated into tropical Africa when the two continents
  became united by the upheaval of the sea-bottom, probably <!-- Page 419
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page419"></a>{419}</span>in the latter
  portion of the Miocene or early in the Pliocene period.<a name="NtA_151"
  href="#Nt_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is clear, therefore, that if Madagascar had once formed part of
  Africa, but had been separated from it before Africa was united to Europe
  and Asia, it would not contain any of those kinds of animals which then
  first entered the country. But, besides the African mammals, we know that
  some birds now confined to Africa then inhabited Europe, and we may
  therefore fairly assume that all the more important groups of birds,
  reptiles, and insects, now abundant in Africa but absent from Madagascar,
  formed no part of the original African fauna, but entered the country
  only after it was joined to Europe and Asia.</p>

  <p><i>Early History of Africa and Madagascar.</i>&mdash;We have seen that
  Madagascar contains an abundance of mammals, and that most of them are of
  types either peculiar to, or existing also in, Africa; it follows that
  that continent must have had an earlier union with Europe, Asia, or
  America, or it could never have obtained any mammals at all.</p>

<p><!-- Page 420 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page420"></a>{420}</span></p>

  <p>Now these ancient African mammals are Lemurs, Insectivora, and small
  Carnivora, chiefly Viverridæ; and all these groups are known to have
  inhabited Europe in Eocene and Miocene times; and that the union was with
  Europe rather than with America is clearly proved by the fact that even
  the insectivorous Centetidæ, now confined to Madagascar and the West
  Indies, inhabited France in the Lower Miocene period, while the
  Viverridæ, or civets, which form so important a part of the fauna of
  Madagascar as well as of Africa, were abundant in Europe throughout the
  whole Tertiary period, but are not known to have ever lived in any part
  of the American continent. We here see the application of the principle
  which we have already fully proved and illustrated (Chapter IV., p. <a
  href="#page60">60</a>), that all extensive groups have a wide range at
  the period of their maximum development; but as they decay their area of
  distribution diminishes or breaks up into detached fragments, which one
  after another disappear till the group becomes extinct. Those animal
  forms which we now find isolated in Madagascar and other remote portions
  of the globe all belong to ancient groups which are in a decaying or
  nearly extinct condition, while those which are absent from it belong to
  more recent and more highly-developed types, which range over extensive
  and continuous areas, but have had no opportunity of reaching the more
  ancient continental islands.</p>

  <p><i>Anomalies of Distribution and How to Explain Them.</i>&mdash;If
  these considerations have any weight, it follows that there is no reason
  whatever for supposing any former direct connection between Madagascar
  and the Greater Antilles merely because the insectivorous Centetidæ now
  exist only in these two groups of islands; for we know that the ancestors
  of this family must once have had a much wider range, which almost
  certainly extended over the great northern continents. We might as
  reasonably suppose a land-connection across the Pacific to account for
  the camels of Asia having their nearest existing allies in the llamas and
  alpacas of the Peruvian Andes, and another between Sumatra and Brazil, in
  order that the ancestral tapir of one country might have passed over to
  the other. In both <!-- Page 421 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page421"></a>{421}</span>these cases we have ample proof of the
  former wide extension of the group. Extinct camels of numerous species
  abounded in North America in Miocene, Pliocene, and even Post-pliocene
  times, and one has also been found in North-western India, but none
  whatever among all the rich deposits of mammalia in Europe. We are thus
  told, as clearly as possible, that from the North American continent as a
  centre the camel tribe spread westward, over now-submerged land at the
  shallow Behring Straits and Kamschatka Sea, into Asia, and southward
  along the Andes into South America. Tapirs are even more interesting and
  instructive. Their remotest known ancestors appear in Western Europe in
  the early portion of the Eocene period; in the latter Eocene and the
  Miocene other forms occur both in Europe and North America. These seem to
  have become extinct in North America, while in Europe they developed
  largely into many forms of true tapirs, which at a much later period
  found their way again to North, and thence to South, America, where their
  remains are found in caves and gravel deposits. It is an instructive fact
  that in the Eastern continent, where they were once so abundant, they
  have dwindled down to a single species, existing in small numbers in the
  Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo only; while in the Western
  continent, where they are comparatively recent immigrants, they occupy a
  much larger area, and are represented by three or four distinct species.
  Who could possibly have imagined such migrations, and extinctions, and
  changes of distribution as are demonstrated in the case of the tapirs, if
  we had only the distribution of the existing species to found an opinion
  upon? Such cases as these&mdash;and there are many others equally
  striking&mdash;show us with the greatest distinctness how nature has
  worked in bringing about the examples of anomalous distribution that
  everywhere meet us; and we must, on every ground of philosophy and common
  sense, apply the same method of interpretation to the more numerous
  instances of anomalous distribution we discover among such groups as
  reptiles, birds, and insects, where we rarely have any direct evidence of
  their past migrations through the discovery of <!-- Page 422 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page422"></a>{422}</span>fossil remains.
  Whenever we can trace the past history of any group of terrestrial
  animals, we invariably find that its actual distribution can be explained
  by migrations effected by means of comparatively slight modifications of
  our existing continents. In no single case have we any direct evidence
  that the distribution of land and sea has been radically changed during
  the whole lapse of the Tertiary and Secondary periods, while, as we have
  already shown in our fifth chapter, the testimony of geology itself, if
  fairly interpreted, upholds the same theory of the stability of our
  continents and the permanence of our oceans. Yet so easy and pleasant is
  it to speculate on former changes of land and sea with which to cut the
  gordian knot offered by anomalies of distribution, that we still
  continually meet with suggestions of former continents stretching in
  every direction across the deepest oceans, in order to explain the
  presence in remote parts of the globe of the same genera even of plants
  or of insects&mdash;organisms which possess such exceptional facilities
  both for terrestrial, aërial, and oceanic transport, and of whose
  distribution in early geological periods we generally know little or
  nothing.</p>

  <p><i>The Birds of Madagascar, as Indicating a Supposed Lemurian
  Continent.</i>&mdash;Having thus shown how the distribution of the land
  mammalia and reptiles of Madagascar may be well explained by the
  supposition of a union with Africa before the greater part of its
  existing fauna had reached it, we have now to consider whether, as some
  ornithologists think, the distribution and affinities of the birds
  present an insuperable objection to this view, and require the adoption
  of a hypothetical continent&mdash;Lemuria&mdash;extending from Madagascar
  to Ceylon and the Malay Islands.</p>

  <p>There are about one hundred and fifty land birds known from the island
  of Madagascar, of which a hundred and twenty-seven are peculiar; and
  about half of these peculiar species belong to peculiar genera, many of
  which are extremely isolated, so that it is often difficult to class them
  in any of the recognised families, or to determine their affinities to
  any living birds.<a name="NtA_152" href="#Nt_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a>
  Among the other moiety, <!-- Page 423 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page423"></a>{423}</span>belonging to known genera, we find fifteen
  which have undoubted African affinities, while five or six are as
  decidedly Oriental, the genera or nearest allied species being found in
  India or the Malay Islands. It is on the presence of these peculiar
  Indian types that Dr. Hartlaub, in his recent work on the <i>Birds of
  Madagascar and the Adjacent Islands</i>, lays great stress, as proving
  the former existence of "Lemuria"; while he considers the absence of such
  peculiar African families as the plantain-eaters, glossy-starlings,
  ox-peckers, barbets, honey-guides, hornbills, and bustards&mdash;besides
  a host of peculiar African genera&mdash;as sufficiently disproving the
  statement in my <i>Geographical Distribution of Animals</i> that
  Madagascar is "more nearly related to the Ethiopian than to any other
  region," and that its fauna was evidently "mainly derived from
  Africa."</p>

  <p>But the absence of the numerous peculiar groups of African birds is so
  exactly parallel to the same phenomenon among mammals, that we are
  justified in imputing it to the same cause, the more especially as some
  of the very groups that are wanting&mdash;the plantain-eaters and the
  trogons, for example,&mdash;are actually known to have inhabited Europe
  along with the large mammalia which subsequently migrated to Africa. As
  to the peculiarly Eastern genera&mdash;such as Copsychus and Hypsipetes,
  with a Dicrurus, a Ploceus, a Cisticola, and a Scops, all closely allied
  to Indian or Malayan species&mdash;although very striking to the
  ornithologist, they certainly do not outweigh the fourteen African genera
  found in Madagascar. Their presence may, moreover, be accounted for more
  satisfactorily than by means of an ancient Lemurian continent, which,
  even if granted, would not explain the very facts adduced in its
  support.</p>

  <p>Let us first prove this latter statement.</p>

  <p>The supposed "Lemuria" must have existed, if at all, at so remote a
  period that the higher animals did not then inhabit either Africa or
  Southern Asia, and it must have <!-- Page 424 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page424"></a>{424}</span>become partially or wholly submerged
  before they reached those countries; otherwise we should find in
  Madagascar many other animals besides Lemurs, Insectivora, and Viverridæ,
  especially such active arboreal creatures as monkeys and squirrels, such
  hardy grazers as deer or antelopes, or such wide-ranging carnivores as
  foxes or bears. This obliges us to date the disappearance of the
  hypothetical continent about the earlier part of the Miocene epoch at
  latest, for during the latter part of that period we know that such
  animals existed in abundance in every part of the great northern
  continents wherever we have found organic remains. But the Oriental birds
  in Madagascar, by whose presence Dr. Hartlaub upholds the theory of a
  Lemuria, are slightly modified forms of <i>existing Indian genera</i>, or
  sometimes, as Dr. Hartlaub himself points out, <i>species hardly
  distinguishable from those of India</i>. Now all the evidence at our
  command leads us to conclude that, even if these genera and species were
  in existence in the early Miocene period, they must have had a widely
  different distribution from what they have now. Along with so many
  African and Indian genera of mammals they then probably inhabited Europe,
  which at that epoch enjoyed a sub-tropical climate; and this is rendered
  almost certain by the discovery in the Miocene of France of fossil
  remains of trogons and jungle-fowl. If, then, these Indian birds date
  back to the very period during which alone Lemuria could have existed,
  that continent was quite unnecessary for their introduction into
  Madagascar, as they could have followed the same track as the mammalia of
  Miocene Europe and Asia; while if, as I maintain, they are of more recent
  date, then Lemuria had ceased to exist, and could not have been the means
  of their introduction.</p>

  <p><i>Submerged Islands between Madagascar and India.</i>&mdash;Looking
  at the accompanying map of the Indian Ocean, we see that between
  Madagascar and India there are now extensive shoals and coral reefs, such
  as are usually held to indicate subsidence; and we may therefore fairly
  postulate the former existence here of several large islands, some of
  them not much inferior to Madagascar itself. These reefs are all
  separated from each other by very deep <!-- Page 425 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page425"></a>{425}</span>sea&mdash;much deeper
  than that which divides Madagascar from Africa, and we have therefore no
  reason to imagine their former union. But they would nevertheless greatly
  facilitate the introduction of Indian birds into the Mascarene Islands
  and Madagascar; and these facilities existing, such an immigration would
  be sure to take place, just as surely as American birds have entered the
  Galapagos and Juan Fernandez, as European birds now reach the Azores, and
  as Australian birds reach such a distant island as New Zealand. This
  would take place the more certainly because the Indian Ocean is a region
  of violent periodical storms at the changes of the monsoons, and we have
  seen in the case of the Azores and Bermuda how important a factor this is
  in determining the transport of birds across the ocean.</p>

  <p>The final disappearance of these now sunken islands does not, in all
  probability, date back to a very remote epoch; and this exactly accords
  with the fact that some of the birds, as well as the fruit-bats of the
  genus Pteropus, are very closely allied to Indian species, if not
  actually identical, others being distinct species of the same genera. The
  fact that not one closely-allied species or even genus of Indian or
  Malayan mammals is found in Madagascar, sufficiently proves that it is no
  land-connection that has brought about this small infusion of Indian
  birds and bats; while we have sufficiently shown, that, when we go back
  to remote geological times no land-connection in this direction was
  necessary to explain the phenomena of the distribution of the Lemurs and
  Insectivora. A land-connection with <i>some</i> continent was undoubtedly
  necessary, or there would have been no mammalia at all in Madagascar; and
  the nature of its fauna on the whole, no less than the moderate depth of
  the intervening strait and the comparative approximation of the opposite
  shores, clearly indicate that the connection was with Africa.</p>

  <p><i>Concluding Remarks on "Lemuria."</i>&mdash;I have gone into this
  question in some detail, because Dr. Hartlaub's criticism on my views has
  been reproduced in a scientific periodical,<a name="NtA_153"
  href="#Nt_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> and the supposed Lemurian continent
  is constantly referred to by quasi-scientific writers, as well as by
  naturalists and geologists, as if its existence had been demonstrated by
  facts, or as if it were absolutely necessary to postulate such a land in
  order to account for the entire series of phenomena connected with the
  Madagascar fauna, and especially with the distribution of the Lemuridæ.<a
  name="NtA_154" href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> I <!-- Page 427
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page427"></a>{427}</span>think I have
  now shown, on the other hand, that it was essentially a provisional
  hypothesis, very useful in calling attention to a remarkable series of
  problems in geographical distribution, but not affording the true
  solution of those problems, any more than the hypothesis of an Atlantis
  solved the problems presented by the Atlantic Islands and the relations
  of the European and North American flora and fauna. The Atlantis is now
  rarely introduced seriously except by the absolutely unscientific, having
  received its death-blow by the chapter on Oceanic Islands in the
  <i>Origin of Species</i>, and the researches of Professor Asa Gray on the
  affinities of the North American and Asiatic floras. But "Lemuria" still
  keeps its place&mdash;a good example of the survival of a provisional
  hypothesis which offers what seems an easy solution of a difficult
  problem, and has received an appropriate and easily remembered name, long
  after it has been proved to be untenable.</p>

  <p>It is now more than fifteen years since I first showed, by a careful
  examination of all the facts to be accounted for, that the hypothesis of
  a Lemurian continent was alike unnecessary to explain one portion of the
  facts, and inadequate to explain the remaining portion.<a name="NtA_155"
  href="#Nt_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> Since that time I have seen no
  attempt even to discuss the question on general grounds in opposition to
  my views, nor on the other hand have those who have hitherto supported
  the hypothesis taken any opportunity of acknowledging its weakness and
  inutility. I have therefore here explained my reasons for rejecting it
  somewhat more fully and in a more popular form, in the hope that a check
  may thus be placed on the continued re-statement of this unsound theory
  as if it were one of the accepted conclusions of modern science.</p>

  <p><i>The Mascarene Islands.</i><a name="NtA_156"
  href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a>&mdash;In the <i>Geographical
  Distribution of Animals</i>, a summary is given of all that was known of
  the zoology of the various islands near Madagascar, which to some extent
  partake of its peculiarities, and with it form the Malagasy sub-region of
  the Ethiopian region. As no great additions have since been made to our
  knowledge of the fauna of these islands, and my object in this volume
  being more especially to illustrate the mode of solving distributional
  problems by means of the most suitable examples, I shall now confine
  myself to pointing out how far the facts presented by these outlying
  islands support the views already enunciated with regard to the origin of
  the Madagascar fauna.</p>

  <p><i>The Comoro Islands.</i>&mdash;This group of islands is situated
  nearly midway between the northern extremity of Madagascar and the coast
  of Africa. The four chief islands vary between sixteen and forty miles in
  length, the largest being 180 miles from the coast of Africa, while one
  or two smaller islets are less than 100 miles from Madagascar. All are
  volcanic, Great Comoro being an active volcano 8,500 feet high; and, as
  already stated, they are situated on a submarine bank with less than 500
  fathoms soundings, connecting Madagascar with Africa. There is reason to
  believe, however, that these islands are of comparatively recent origin,
  and that the bank has been formed by matter ejected by the volcanoes or
  by upheaval. Anyhow, there is no indication whatever of there having been
  here a land-connection between Madagascar and Africa; while the islands
  themselves have been mainly colonised from Madagascar, some of them
  making a near approach to the 100-fathom bank which surrounds that
  island.</p>

  <p>The Comoros contain two land mammals, a lemur and a civet, both of
  Madagascar genera and the latter an identical species, and there is also
  a peculiar species of fruit-bat (<i>Pteropus comorensis</i>), a group
  which ranges from Australia to Asia and Madagascar but is unknown in
  Africa. Of land-birds forty-one species are known, of <!-- Page 429
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page429"></a>{429}</span>which sixteen
  are peculiar to the islands, twenty-one are found also in Madagascar, and
  three found in Africa and not in Madagascar; while of the peculiar
  species, six belong to Madagascar or Mascarene genera. A species of
  Chameleon is also peculiar to the islands.</p>

  <p>These facts point to the conclusion that the Comoro Islands have been
  formerly more nearly connected with Madagascar than they are now,
  probably by means of intervening islets and the former extension of the
  latter island to the westward, as indicated by the extensive shallow bank
  at its northern extremity, so as to allow of the easy passage of birds,
  and the occasional transmission of small mammalia by means of floating
  trees.<a name="NtA_157" href="#Nt_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>The Seychelles Archipelago.</i>&mdash;This interesting group
  consists of about thirty small islands situated 700 miles N.N.E. of
  Madagascar, or almost exactly in the line formed by continuing the
  central ridge of that great island. The Seychelles stand upon a rather
  extensive shallow bank, the 100-fathom line around them enclosing an area
  nearly 200 miles long by 100 miles wide, while the 500-fathom line shows
  an extension of nearly 100 miles in a southern direction. All the larger
  islands are of granite, with mountains rising to 3,000 feet in Mahé, and
  to from 1,000 to 2,000 feet in several of the other islands. We can
  therefore hardly doubt that they form a portion of the great line of
  upheaval which produced the central granitic mass of Madagascar,
  intervening points being indicated by the Amirantes, the Providence, and
  the Farquhar Islands, which, though all coralline, probably rest on a
  granitic basis. Deep channels of more than 1,000 fathoms now separate
  these islands from each other, and if they were ever sufficiently
  elevated to be united, it was probably at a very remote epoch.</p>

  <p>The Seychelles may thus have had ample facilities for receiving from
  Madagascar such immigrants as can pass over narrow seas; and, on the
  other hand, they were equally favourably situated as regards the
  extensive Saya de Malha and Cargados banks, which were probably once <!--
  Page 430 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page430"></a>{430}</span>large
  islands, and may have supported a rich insular flora and fauna of mixed
  Mascarene and Indian type. The existing fauna and flora of the Seychelles
  must therefore be looked upon as the remnants which have survived the
  partial submergence of a very extensive island; and the entire absence of
  non-aërial mammalia may be due, either to this island having never been
  actually united to Madagascar, or to its having since undergone so much
  submergence as to have led to the extinction of such mammals as may once
  have inhabited it. The birds and reptiles, however, though few in number,
  are very interesting, and throw some further light on the past history of
  the Seychelles.</p>

  <p><i>Birds of the Seychelles.</i>&mdash;Fifteen indigenous land-birds
  are known to inhabit the group, thirteen of which are peculiar species,<a
  name="NtA_158" href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> belonging to genera
  which occur also in Madagascar or Africa. The genera which are more
  peculiarly Indian are,&mdash;Copsychus and Hypsipetes, also found in
  Madagascar; and Palæornis, which has species in Mauritius and Rodriguez,
  as well as one on the continent of Africa. A black parrot (Coracopsis),
  congeneric with two species that inhabit Madagascar and with one that is
  peculiar to the Comoros; and a beautiful red-headed blue pigeon
  (<i>Alectorænas pulcherrimus</i>) allied to those of Madagascar and
  Mauritius, but very distinct, are the most remarkable species
  characteristic of this group of islands.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles and Amphibia of the Seychelles.</i>&mdash;The reptiles and
  amphibia are rather numerous and very interesting, indicating clearly
  that the islands can hardly be classed as oceanic. There are seven
  species of lizards, three being peculiar to the islands, while the others
  have rather a wide range. The first is a chameleon&mdash;defenceless <!--
  Page 431 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page431"></a>{431}</span>slow-moving lizards, especially abundant
  in Madagascar, from which no less than eighteen species are now known,
  about the same number as on the continent of Africa. The Seychelles
  species (<i>Chamæleon tigris</i>) also occurs at Zanzibar. The next are
  skinks (Scincidæ), small ground-lizards with a wide distribution in the
  Eastern hemisphere. Two species are however peculiar to the
  islands&mdash;<i>Mabuia seychellensis</i> and <i>M. wrightii</i>. The
  other peculiar species is one of the geckoes (Geckotidæ) named
  <i>Æluronyx seychellensis</i>, and there are also three other geckoes,
  <i>Phelsuma madagascarensis</i>, <i>Gehyra mutilata</i> and
  <i>Hemidactylus frenatus</i>, the two latter having a wide distribution
  in the tropical regions of both hemispheres. These lizards, clinging as
  they do to trees and timber, are exceedingly liable to be carried in
  ships from one country to another, and I am told by Dr. Günther that some
  are found almost every year in the London Docks. It is therefore
  probable, that when species of this family have a very wide range they
  have been assisted in their migrations by man, though their habit of
  clinging to trees also renders them likely to be floated with large
  pieces of timber to considerable distances. Dr. Percival Wright, to whom
  I am indebted for much information on the productions of the Seychelles
  Archipelago, informs me that the last-named species varies greatly in
  colour in the different islands, so that he could always tell from which
  particular island a specimen had been brought. This is analogous to the
  curious fact of certain lizards on the small islands in the Mediterranean
  being always very different in colour from those of the mainland, usually
  becoming rich blue or black (see <i>Nature</i>, Vol. XIX. p. 97); and we
  thus learn how readily in some cases differences of colour are brought
  about, either directly or indirectly, by local conditions.</p>

  <p>Snakes, as is usually the case in small or remote islands, are far
  less numerous than lizards, only two species being known. One,
  <i>Dromicus seychellensis</i>, is a peculiar species of the family
  Colubridæ, the rest of the genus being found in Madagascar and South
  America. The other, <i>Boodon geometricus</i>, one of the Lycodontidæ, or
  fanged ground-snakes, is also peculiar. So far, then, as the reptiles are
  <!-- Page 432 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page432"></a>{432}</span>concerned, there is nothing but what is
  easily explicable by what we know of the general means of distribution of
  these animals.</p>

  <p>We now come to the Amphibia, which are represented in the Seychelles
  by two tailless and two serpent-like forms. The frogs are <i>Rana
  mascareniensis</i>, found also in Mauritius, Bourbon, Angola, and
  Abyssinia, and probably all over tropical Africa; and <i>Megalixalus
  seychellensis</i> a peculiar tree-frog having allies in Madagascar and
  tropical Africa. It is found, Dr. Wright informs me, on the Pandani or
  screw-pines; and as these form a very characteristic portion of the
  vegetation of the Mascarene Islands, all the species being peculiar and
  confined each to a single island or small group, we may perhaps consider
  it as a relic of the indigenous fauna of that more extensive land of
  which the present islands are the remains.</p>

  <p>The serpentine Amphibia are represented by two species of Cæcilia.
  These creatures externally resemble large worms, except that they have a
  true head with jaws and rudimentary eyes, while internally they have of
  course a true vertebrate skeleton. They live underground, burrowing by
  means of the ring-like folds of the skin which simulate the jointed
  segments of a worm's body, and when caught they exude a viscid slime. The
  young have external gills which are afterwards replaced by true lungs,
  and this peculiar metamorphosis shows that they belong to the amphibia
  rather than to the reptiles. The Cæcilias are widely but very sparingly
  distributed through all the tropical regions; a fact which may, as we
  have seen, be taken as an indication of the great antiquity of the group,
  and that it is now verging towards extinction. In the Seychelles Islands
  there appear to be three species of these singular animals.
  <i>Cryptopsophis multiplicatus</i> is confined to the islands; <i>Herpele
  squalostoma</i> is found also in Western India and in Africa; while
  <i>Hypogeophis rostratus</i> inhabits both West Africa and South
  America.<a name="NtA_159" href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a> This last
  is certainly one of the most remarkable cases of the wide and
  discontinuous distribution of a species; and <!-- Page 433 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page433"></a>{433}</span>when we consider the
  habits of life of these animals and the extreme slowness with which it is
  likely they can migrate into new areas, we can hardly arrive at any other
  conclusion than that this species once had an almost world-wide range,
  and that in the process of dying out it has been left stranded, as it
  were, in these three remote portions of the globe. The extreme stability
  and long persistence of specific form which this implies is
  extraordinary, but not unprecedented, among the lower vertebrates. The
  crocodiles of the Eocene period differ but slightly from those of the
  present day, while a small freshwater turtle from the Pliocene deposits
  of the Siwalik Hills is absolutely identical with a still living Indian
  species, <i>Emys tectus</i>. The mud-fish of Australia, <i>Ceratodus
  forsteri</i> is a very ancient type, and may well have remained
  specifically unchanged since early Tertiary times. It is not, therefore,
  incredible that this Seychelles Cæcilia may be the oldest land vertebrate
  now living on the globe; dating back to the early part of the Tertiary
  period, when the warm climate of the northern hemisphere in high
  latitudes and the union of the Asiatic and American continents allowed of
  the migration of such types over the whole northern hemisphere, from
  which they subsequently passed into the southern hemisphere, maintaining
  themselves only in certain limited areas, where the physical conditions
  were especially favourable, or where they were saved from the attacks of
  enemies or the competition of higher forms.</p>

  <p><i>Fresh-water Fishes.</i>&mdash;The only other vertebrates in the
  Seychelles are two fresh-water fishes abounding in the streams and
  rivulets. One, <i>Haplochilus playfairii</i> is peculiar to the islands,
  but there are allied species in Madagascar. It is a pretty little fish
  about four inches long, of an olive colour, with rows of red spots, and
  is very abundant in some of the mountain streams. The fishes of this
  genus, as I am informed by Dr. Günther, often inhabit both sea and fresh
  water, so that their migration from <!-- Page 434 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page434"></a>{434}</span>Madagascar to the
  Seychelles and subsequent modification, offers no difficulty. The other
  species is <i>Fundulus orthonotus</i>, found also on the east coast of
  Africa; and as both belong to the same
  family&mdash;Cyprinodontidæ&mdash;this may possibly have migrated in a
  similar manner.</p>

  <p><i>Land-shells.</i>&mdash;The only other group of animals inhabiting
  the Seychelles which we know with any approach to completeness, are the
  land and fresh-water mollusca, but they do not furnish any facts of
  special interest. About forty species are known, and Mr. Geoffrey Nevill,
  who has studied them, thinks their meagre number is chiefly owing to the
  destruction of so much of the forests which once covered the islands.
  Seven of the species&mdash;and among them one of the most conspicuous,
  <i>Achatina fulica</i>&mdash;have almost certainly been introduced; and
  the remainder show a mixture of Madagascar and Indian forms, with a
  preponderance of the latter. Five genera&mdash;Streptaxis, Cyathoponea,
  Onchidium, Helicina and Paludomus, are mentioned as being especially
  Indian, while only two&mdash;Tropidophora and Gibbus, are found in
  Madagascar but not in India.<a name="NtA_160"
  href="#Nt_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> About two-thirds of the species
  appear to be peculiar to the islands.</p>

  <p><i>Mauritius, Bourbon and Rodriguez.</i>&mdash;These three islands are
  somewhat out of place in this chapter, because they really belong to the
  oceanic group, being of volcanic formation, surrounded by deep sea, and
  possessing no indigenous mammals or amphibia. Yet their productions are
  so closely related to those of Madagascar, to which they may be
  considered as attendant satellites, that it is absolutely necessary to
  associate them together if we wish to comprehend and explain their many
  interesting features.</p>

  <p>Mauritius and Bourbon are lofty volcanic islands, evidently of great
  antiquity. They are about 100 miles apart, and the sea between them is
  less than 1,000 fathoms deep, while on each side it sinks rapidly to
  depths of 2,400 and 2,600 fathoms. We have therefore no reason to believe
  that they have ever been connected with <!-- Page 435 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page435"></a>{435}</span>Madagascar, and this
  view is strongly supported by the character of their indigenous fauna. Of
  this, however, we have not a very complete or accurate knowledge, for
  though both islands have long been occupied by Europeans, the study of
  their natural products was for a long time greatly neglected, and owing
  to the rapid spread of sugar cultivation, the virgin forests, and with
  them no doubt many native animals, have been almost wholly destroyed.
  There is, however, no good evidence of there ever having been any
  indigenous mammals or amphibia, though both are now found and are often
  recorded among the native animals.<a name="NtA_161"
  href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The smaller and more remote island, Rodriguez, is also volcanic; but
  it has, besides a good deal of coralline rock, an indication of partial
  submergence helping to account for the poverty of its fauna and flora. It
  stands on a 100-fathom bank of considerable extent, but beyond this the
  <!-- Page 436 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page436"></a>{436}</span>sea rapidly deepens to more than 2,000
  fathoms, so that it is truly oceanic like its larger sister isles.</p>

  <p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;The living birds of these islands are few in
  number and consist mainly of peculiar species of Mascarene types,
  together with two peculiar genera&mdash;Oxynotus belonging to the
  Campephagidæ or caterpillar-catchers, a family abundant in the old-world
  tropics; and a dove, Trocazza, forming a peculiar sub-genus. The origin
  of these birds offers no difficulty, looking at the position of the
  islands and of the surrounding shoals and islets.</p>

  <p><i>Extinct Birds.</i>&mdash;These three islands are, however,
  preeminently remarkable as having been the home of a group of large
  ground-birds, quite incapable of flight, and altogether unlike anything
  found elsewhere on the globe; and which, though once very abundant, have
  become totally extinct within the last two hundred years. The best known
  of these birds is the dodo, which inhabited Mauritius; while allied
  species certainly lived in Bourbon and Rodriguez, abundant remains of the
  species of the latter island&mdash;the "solitaire," having been
  discovered, corresponding with the figure and description given of it by
  Legouat, who resided in Rodriguez in 1692. These birds constitute a
  distinct family, Dididæ, allied to the pigeons but very isolated. They
  were quite defenceless, and were rapidly exterminated when man introduced
  dogs, pigs, and cats into the island, and himself sought them for food.
  The fact that such perfectly unprotected creatures survived in great
  abundance to a quite recent period in these three islands only, while
  there is no evidence of their ever having inhabited any other countries
  whatever, is itself almost demonstrative that Mauritius, Bourbon, and
  Rodriguez are very ancient but truly oceanic islands. From what we know
  of the general similarity of Miocene birds to living genera and families,
  it seems clear that the origin of so remarkable a type as the dodos must
  date back to early Tertiary times. If we suppose some ancestral
  ground-feeding pigeon of large size to have reached the group by means of
  intervening islands afterwards submerged, and to have thenceforth
  remained to increase and multiply unchecked by the attacks of any more
  <!-- Page 437 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page437"></a>{437}</span>powerful animals, we can well understand
  that the wings, being useless, would in time become almost aborted.<a
  name="NtA_162" href="#Nt_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> It is also not
  improbable that this process would be aided by natural selection, because
  the use of wings might be absolutely prejudicial to the birds in their
  new home. Those that flew up into trees to roost, or tried to cross over
  the mouths of rivers, might be blown out to sea and destroyed, especially
  during the hurricanes which have probably always more or less devastated
  the islands; while on the other hand the more bulky and short-winged
  individuals, who took to sleeping on the ground in the forest, would be
  preserved from such dangers, and perhaps also from the attacks of birds
  of prey which may always have visited the islands. But whether or no this
  was the mode by which these singular birds acquired their actual form and
  structure, it is perfectly certain that their existence and development
  depended on complete isolation and on freedom from the attacks of
  enemies. We have no single example of such defenceless birds having ever
  existed on a continent at any geological period, whereas analogous though
  totally distinct forms do exist in New Zealand, where enemies are equally
  wanting. On the other hand, every continent has always produced abundance
  of carnivora adapted to prey upon the herbivorous animals inhabiting it
  at the same period; and we may therefore be sure that <!-- Page 438
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page438"></a>{438}</span>these islands
  have never formed part of a continent during any portion of the time when
  the dodos inhabited them.</p>

  <p>It is a remarkable thing that an ornithologist of Dr. Hartlaub's
  reputation, looking at the subject from a purely ornithological point of
  view, should yet entirely ignore the evidence of these wonderful and
  unique birds against his own theory, when he so confidently characterises
  Lemuria as "that sunken land, which, containing parts of Africa, must
  have extended far eastward over Southern India and Ceylon, and the
  highest points of which we recognise in the volcanic peaks of Bourbon and
  Mauritius, and in the central range of Madagascar itself&mdash;the last
  resorts of the mostly extinct Lemurine race which formerly peopled it."<a
  name="NtA_163" href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> It is here implied
  that lemurs formerly inhabited Bourbon and Mauritius, but of this there
  is not a particle of evidence, and we feel pretty sure that had they done
  so the dodos would never have been developed there. In Madagascar there
  are no traces of dodos, while there are remains of extinct gigantic
  struthious birds of the genus Æpyornis, which were no doubt as well able
  to protect themselves against the smaller carnivora as are the ostriches,
  emus, and cassowaries in their respective countries at the present
  day.</p>

  <p>The whole of the evidence at our command, therefore, tends to
  establish in a very complete manner the "oceanic" character of the three
  islands&mdash;Mauritius, Bourbon, and Rodriguez, and that they have never
  formed part of "Lemuria" or of any continent.</p>

  <p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;Mauritius, like Bourbon, has lizards, some of
  which are peculiar species; but no snakes, and no frogs or toads but such
  as have been introduced.<a name="NtA_164"
  href="#Nt_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> Strange to say, however, a small
  islet called Round Island, only about a mile across, and situated about
  fourteen miles north-east of Mauritius, possesses a snake which is not
  only unknown in Mauritius, but also in any other part of the world, being
  <!-- Page 439 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page439"></a>{439}</span>altogether confined to this minute islet!
  It belongs to the boa family, and forms a peculiar and very distinct
  genus, Casaria, whose nearest allies seem to be the Ungalia of Cuba and
  Bolyeria of Australia. It is hardly possible to believe that this serpent
  has very long maintained itself on so small an island; and though we have
  no record of its existence on Mauritius, it may very well have inhabited
  the lowland forests without being met with by the early settlers; and the
  introduction of swine, which soon ran wild and effected the final
  destruction of the dodo, may also have been fatal to this snake. It is,
  however, now almost certainly confined to the one small islet, and is
  probably the land-vertebrate of most restricted distribution on the
  globe.</p>

  <p>On the same island there is a small lizard, <i>Scelotes bojeri</i>,
  recorded also from Mauritius and Bourbon, though it appears to be rare in
  both islands; but a gecko, <i>Phelsuma guentheri</i>, is restricted to
  the island. As Round Island is connected with Mauritius by a bank under a
  hundred fathoms below the surface, it has probably been once joined to
  it, and when first separated would have been both much larger and much
  nearer the main island, circumstances which would greatly facilitate the
  transmission of these reptiles to their present dwelling-place, where
  they have been able to maintain themselves owing to the complete absence
  of competition, while some of them have become extinct in the larger
  island.</p>

  <p><i>Flora of Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands.</i>&mdash;The botany
  of the great island of Madagascar has been perhaps more thoroughly
  explored than that of the opposite coasts of Africa, so that its
  peculiarities may not be really so great as they now appear to be. Yet
  there can be no doubt of its extreme richness and grandeur, its
  remarkable speciality, and its anomalous external relations. It is
  characterised by a great abundance of forest-trees and shrubs of peculiar
  genera or species, and often adorned with magnificent flowers. Some of
  these are allied to African forms, others to those of Asia, and it is
  said that of the two affinities the latter preponderates. But there are
  also, as in the animal world, some decided South <!-- Page 440 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page440"></a>{440}</span>American relations,
  while other groups point to Australia, or are altogether isolated.</p>

  <p>No less than 3,740 flowering plants are now known from Madagascar with
  360 ferns and fern-allies. The most abundant natural orders are the
  following:</p>

  <p>The flora contains representatives of 144 natural orders and 970
  genera, one of the former and 148 of the latter being peculiar to the
  island. The peculiar order, Chælnaceæ, comprises seven genera and
  twenty-four species; while Rubiaceæ and Compositæ have the largest number
  of peculiar genera, followed by Leguminosæ and Melastomaceæ. Nearly
  three-fourths of the species are endemic.</p>

  <p>Beautiful flowers are not conspicuous in the flora of Madagascar,
  though it contains several magnificent flowering plants. A shrub with the
  dreadful name <i>Harpagophytum Grandidieri</i> has bunches of gorgeous
  red flowers; <i>Tristellateia madagascariensis</i> is a climbing plant
  with spikes of rich yellow flowers; while <i>Poinciana regia</i>, a tall
  tree, <i>Rhodolæna altivola</i> and <i>Astrap&oelig;a Wallichii</i>,
  shrubs, are among the most magnificent flowering plants in the world.
  <i>Disa Buchenaviana</i>, <i>Commelina madagascarica</i>, and
  <i>Tachiadenus platypterus</i> are fine blue-flowered plants, while the
  superb orchid <i>Angræcum sesquipedale</i>, <i>Vinca rosea</i>,
  <i>Euphorbia splendens</i>, and <i>Stephanotis floribunda</i>, have been
  long cultivated in our hot-houses. There are also many handsome
  Combretaceæ, Rubiaceæ, and Leguminosæ; but, as in most tropical regions,
  this wealth of floral beauty has to be searched for, and produces little
  effect in the landscape.</p>

  <p>The affinities of the Madagascar flora are to a great extent in
  accordance with those of the fauna. The tropical portion of the flora
  agrees closely with that of tropical Africa, while the plants of the
  highlands are <!-- Page 441 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page441"></a>{441}</span>equally allied to those of the Cape and of
  the mountains of Central Africa. Some Asiatic types are present which do
  not occur in Africa; and even the curious American affinities of some of
  the animals are reproduced in the vegetable kingdom. These last are so
  interesting that they deserve to be enumerated. An American genus of
  Euphorbiaceæ, Omphalea, has one species in Madagascar, and Pedilanthus,
  another genus of the same natural order, has a similar distribution.
  Myrosma, an American genus of Scitamineæ has one Madagascar species;
  while the celebrated "travellers' tree," <i>Ravenala
  madagascariensis</i>, belonging to the order Musaceæ, has its nearest
  ally in a plant inhabiting N. Brazil and Guiana. Echinolæna, a genus of
  grasses, has the same distribution.<a name="NtA_165"
  href="#Nt_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Of the flora of the smaller Madagascarian islands we possess a fuller
  account, owing to the recent publication of Mr. Baker's <i>Flora of the
  Mauritius and the Seychelles</i>, including also Rodriguez. The total
  number of species in this flora is 1,058, more than half of which (536)
  are exclusively Mascarene&mdash;that is, found only in some of the
  islands of the Madagascar group, while nearly a third (304) are endemic
  or confined to single islands. Of the widespread plants sixty-six are
  found in Africa but not in Asia, and eighty-six in Asia but not in
  Africa, showing a similar Asiatic preponderance to what is said to occur
  in Madagascar. With the genera, however, the proportions are different,
  for I find by going through the whole of the generic distributions as
  given by Mr. Baker, that out of the 440 genera of wild plants fifty are
  endemic, twenty-two are Asiatic but not African, while twenty-eight are
  African but not Asiatic. This implies that the more ancient connection
  has been on the side of Africa, while a more recent immigration, shown by
  identity of species, has come from the side of Asia; and it is already
  certain that when the flora of Madagascar is more thoroughly worked out,
  a still greater African preponderance will be found in that island.</p>

<p><!-- Page 442 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page442"></a>{442}</span></p>

  <p>A few Mascarene genera are found elsewhere only in South America,
  Australia, or Polynesia; and there are also a considerable number of
  genera whose metropolis is South America, but which are represented by
  one or more species in Madagascar, and by a single often widely
  distributed species in Africa. This fact throws light upon the problem
  offered by those mammals, reptiles, and insects of Madagascar which now
  have their only allies in South America, since the two cases would be
  exactly parallel were the African plants to become extinct. Plants,
  however, are undoubtedly more long-lived specifically than
  animals&mdash;especially the more highly organised groups, and are less
  liable to complete extinction through the attacks of enemies or through
  changes of climate or of physical geography; hence we find comparatively
  few cases in which groups of Madagascar plants have their <i>only</i>
  allies in such distant regions as America and Australia, while such cases
  are numerous among animals, owing to the extinction of the allied forms
  in intervening areas, for which extinction, as we have already shown,
  ample cause can be assigned.</p>

  <p><i>Curious Relations of Mascarene Plants.</i>&mdash;Among the curious
  affinities of Mascarene plants we have culled the following from Mr.
  Baker's volume. Trochetia, a genus of Sterculiaceæ, has four species in
  Mauritius, one in Madagascar, and one in the remote island of St. Helena.
  Mathurina, a genus of Turneraceæ, consisting of a single species peculiar
  to Rodriguez, has its nearest ally in another monotypic genus, Erblichia,
  confined to Central America. Siegesbeckia, one of the Compositæ, consists
  of two species, one inhabiting the Mascarene islands, the other Peru.
  Labourdonasia, a genus of Sapotaceæ, has two species in Mauritius, one in
  Natal, and one in Cuba. Nesogenes, belonging to the verbena family, has
  one species in Rodriguez and one in Polynesia. Mespilodaphne, an
  extensive genus of Lauraceæ, has six species in the Mascarene islands,
  and all the rest (about fifty species) in South America. Nepenthes, the
  well-known pitcher plants, are found chiefly in the Malay Islands, South
  China, and Ceylon, with species in the Seychelles Islands, <!-- Page 443
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page443"></a>{443}</span>and in
  Madagascar. Milla, a large genus of Liliaceæ, is exclusively American,
  except one species found in Mauritius and Bourbon. Agauria, a genus of
  Ericaceæ, is found in Madagascar, the Mascarene islands, the plateau of
  Central Africa, and the Camaroon Mountains in West Africa. An acacia,
  found in Mauritius and Bourbon (<i>A. heterophylla</i>), can hardly be
  separated specifically from <i>Acacia koa</i> of the Sandwich Islands.
  The genus Pandanus, or screw-pine, has sixteen species in the three
  islands&mdash;Mauritius, Rodriguez, and the Seychelles&mdash;all being
  peculiar, and none ranging beyond a single island. Of palms there are
  fifteen species belonging to ten genera, and all these genera are
  peculiar to the islands. We have here ample evidence that plants exhibit
  the same anomalies of distribution in these islands as do the animals,
  though in a smaller proportion; while they also exhibit some of the
  transitional stages by which these anomalies have, in all probability,
  been brought about, rendering quite unnecessary any other changes in the
  distribution of sea and land than physical and geological evidence
  warrants.<a name="NtA_166" href="#Nt_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 444 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page444"></a>{444}</span></p>

  <p><i>Fragmentary Character of the Mascarene Flora.</i>&mdash;Although
  the peculiar character and affinities of the vegetation of these islands
  is sufficiently apparent, there can be little doubt that we only possess
  a fragment of the rich flora which once adorned them. The cultivation of
  sugar, and other tropical products, has led to the clearing away of the
  virgin forests from all the lowlands, plateaus, and accessible slopes of
  the mountains, so that remains of the aboriginal woodlands only linger in
  the recesses of the hills, and numbers of forest-haunting plants must
  inevitably have been exterminated. The result is, that nearly three
  hundred species of foreign plants have run wild in Mauritius, and have in
  their turn helped to extinguish the native <!-- Page 445 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page445"></a>{445}</span>species. In the
  Seychelles, too, the indigenous flora has been almost entirely destroyed
  in most of the islands, although the peculiar palms, from their longevity
  and comparative hardiness, have survived. Mr. Geoffrey Nevill tells us,
  that at Mahé, and most of the other islands visited by him, it was only
  in a few spots near the summits of the hills that he could perceive any
  remains of the ancient flora. Pine-apples, cinnamon, bamboos, and other
  plants have obtained a firm footing, covering large tracts of country and
  killing the more delicate native flowers and ferns. The pine-apple,
  especially, grows almost to the tops of the mountains. Where the timber
  and shrubs have been destroyed, the water falling on the surface
  immediately cuts channels, runs off rapidly, and causes the land to
  become dry and arid; and the same effect is largely seen both in
  Mauritius and Bourbon, where, originally, dense forest covered the entire
  surface, and perennial moisture, with its ever-accompanying luxuriance of
  vegetation, prevailed.</p>

  <p><i>Flora of Madagascar Allied to that of South Africa.</i>&mdash;In my
  <i>Geographical Distribution of Animals</i> I have remarked on the
  relation between the insects of Madagascar and those of south temperate
  Africa, and have speculated on a great <i>southern</i> extension of the
  continent at the time when Madagascar was united with it. As supporting
  this view I now quote Mr. Bentham's remarks on the Compositæ. He says:
  "The connections of the Mascarene endemic Compositæ, especially those of
  Madagascar itself, are eminently with the southern and sub-tropical
  African races; the more tropical races, Plucheineæ, &amp;c., may be
  rather more of an Asiatic type." He further says that the Composite flora
  is almost as strictly endemic as that of the Sandwich Islands, and that
  it is much diversified, with evidences of great antiquity, while it shows
  insular characteristics in the tendency to tall shrubby or arborescent
  forms in several of the endemic or prevailing genera.</p>

  <p><i>Preponderance of Ferns in the Mascarene Flora.</i>&mdash;A striking
  character of the flora of these smaller Mascarene islands is the great
  preponderance of ferns, and next to them of orchideæ. The following
  figures are taken from <!-- Page 446 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page446"></a>{446}</span>Mr. Baker's <i>Flora</i> for Mauritius and
  the Seychelles, and from an estimate by M. Frappier of the flora of
  Bourbon given in Maillard's volume already quoted:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The cause of the great preponderance of ferns in oceanic islands has
  already been discussed in my book on <i>Tropical Nature</i>; and we have
  seen that Mauritius, Bourbon, and Rodriguez must be classed as such,
  though from their proximity to Madagascar they have to be considered as
  satellites to that great island. The abundance of orchids, the reverse of
  what occurs in remoter oceanic islands, may be in part due to analogous
  causes. Their usually minute and abundant seeds would be as easily
  carried by the wind as the spores of ferns, and their frequent epiphytic
  habit affords them an endless variety of stations on which to vegetate,
  and at the same time removes them in a great measure from the competition
  of other plants. When, therefore, the climate is sufficiently moist and
  equable, and there is a luxuriant forest vegetation, we may expect to
  find orchids plentiful on such tropical islands as possess an abundance
  of insects adapted to fertilise them, and which are not too far removed
  from other lands or continents from which their seeds might be
  conveyed.</p>

  <p><i>Concluding Remarks on Madagascar and the Mascarene
  Islands.</i>&mdash;There is probably no portion of the globe that
  contains within itself so many and such varied features of interest
  connected with geographical distribution, or which so well illustrates
  the mode of solving the problems it presents, as the comparatively small
  insular region which comprises the great island of Madagascar and the
  smaller islands and island-groups which immediately surround it. In
  Madagascar we have a continental island of the first rank, and
  undoubtedly of immense antiquity; we have detached fragments of this
  island in the Comoros and <!-- Page 447 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page447"></a>{447}</span>Aldabra; in the Seychelles we have the
  fragments of another very ancient island, which may perhaps never have
  been continental; in Mauritius, Bourbon, and Rodriguez we have three
  undoubtedly oceanic islands; while in the extensive banks and coral reefs
  of Cargados, Saya de Malha, the Chagos, and the Maldive Isles, we have
  indications of the submergence of many large islands which may have aided
  in the transmission of organisms from the Indian Peninsula. But between
  and around all these islands we have depths of 2,500 fathoms and upwards,
  which renders it very improbable that there has ever been here a
  continuous land surface, at all events during the Tertiary or Secondary
  periods of geology.</p>

  <p>It is most interesting and satisfactory to find that this conclusion,
  arrived at solely by a study of the form of the sea-bottom and the
  general principle of oceanic permanence, is fully supported by the
  evidence of the organic productions of the several islands; because it
  gives us confidence in those principles, and helps to supply us with a
  practical demonstration of them. We find that the entire group contains
  just that amount of Indian forms which could well have passed from island
  to island; that many of these forms are slightly modified species,
  indicating that the migration occurred during late Tertiary times, while
  others are distinct genera, indicating a more ancient connection; but in
  no one case do we find animals which necessitate an actual
  land-connection, while the numerous Indian types of mammalia, reptiles,
  birds, and insects, which must certainly have passed over had there been
  such an actual land-connection, are totally wanting. The one fact which
  has been supposed to require such a connection&mdash;the distribution of
  the lemurs&mdash;can be far more naturally explained by a general
  dispersion of the group from Europe, where we know it existed in Eocene
  times; and such an explanation applies equally to the affinity of the
  Insectivora of Madagascar and Cuba; the snakes (Herpetodryas, &amp;c.) of
  Madagascar and America; and the lizards (Cryptoblepharus) of Mauritius
  and Australia. To suppose, in all these cases, and in many others, a
  direct land-connection, is really absurd, because <!-- Page 448 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page448"></a>{448}</span>we have the evidence
  afforded by geology of wide differences of distribution directly we pass
  beyond the most recent deposits; and when we go back to
  Mesozoic&mdash;and still more to Palæozoic&mdash;times, the majority of
  the groups of animals and plants appear to have had a world-wide range. A
  large number of our European Miocene genera of vertebrates were also
  Indian or African, or even American; the South American Tertiary fauna
  contained many European types; while many Mesozoic reptiles and mollusca
  ranged from Europe and North America to Australia and New Zealand.</p>

  <p>By very good evidence (the occurrence of wide areas of marine deposits
  of Eocene age), geologists have established the fact that Africa was cut
  off from Europe and Asia by an arm of the sea in early Tertiary times,
  forming a large island-continent. By the evidence of abundant organic
  remains we know that all the types of large mammalia now found in Africa
  (but which are absent from Madagascar) inhabited Europe and Asia, and
  many of them also North America, in the Miocene period. At a still
  earlier epoch Africa may have received its lower types of
  mammals&mdash;lemurs, insectivora, and small carnivora, together with its
  ancestral struthious birds, and its reptiles and insects of American or
  Australian affinity; and at this period it was joined to Madagascar.
  Before the later continental period of Africa, Madagascar had become an
  island; and thus, when the large mammalia from the northern continent
  overran Africa, they were prevented from reaching Madagascar, which
  thenceforth was enabled to develop its singular forms of low-type
  mammalia, its gigantic ostrich-like Æpyornis, its isolated birds, its
  remarkable insects, and its rich and peculiar flora. From it the adjacent
  islands received such organisms as could cross the sea; while they
  transmitted to Madagascar some of the Indian birds and insects which had
  reached them.</p>

  <p>The method we have followed in these investigations is to accept the
  results of geological and palæontological science, and the ascertained
  facts as to the powers of dispersal of the various animal groups; to take
  full account of the laws of evolution as affecting distribution, <!--
  Page 449 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page449"></a>{449}</span>and
  of the various ocean depths as implying recent or remote union of islands
  with their adjacent continents; and the result is, that wherever we
  possess a sufficient knowledge of these various classes of evidence, we
  find it possible to give a connected and intelligible explanation of all
  the most striking peculiarities of the organic world. In Madagascar we
  have undoubtedly one of the most difficult of these problems; but we
  have, I think, fairly met and conquered most of its difficulties. The
  complexity of the organic relations of this island is due, partly to its
  having derived its animal forms from two distinct sources&mdash;from one
  continent through a direct land-connection, and from another by means of
  intervening islands now submerged; but, mainly to the fact of its having
  been separated from a continent which is now, zoologically, in a very
  different condition from that which prevailed at the time of the
  separation; and to its having been thus able to preserve a number of
  types which may date back to the Eocene, or even to the Cretaceous,
  period. Some of these types have become altogether extinct elsewhere;
  others have spread far and wide over the globe, and have survived only in
  a few remote countries&mdash;and especially in those which have been more
  or less secured by their isolated position from the incursions of the
  more highly-developed forms of later times. This explains why it is that
  the nearest allies of the Madagascar fauna and flora are now so often to
  be found in South America or Australia&mdash;countries in which low forms
  of mammalia and birds still largely prevail;&mdash;it being on account of
  the long-continued isolation of all these countries that similar forms
  (descendants of ancient types) are preserved in them. Had the numerous
  suggested continental extensions connecting these remote continents at
  various geological periods been realities, the result would have been
  that all these interesting archaic forms, all these defenceless insular
  types, would long ago have been exterminated, and one comparatively
  monotonous fauna have reigned over the whole earth. So far from
  explaining the anomalous facts, the alleged continental extensions, had
  they existed, would have left no such facts to be explained.</p>

  <p>The only other islands of the globe which can be classed as "ancient
  continental" are the larger Antilles (Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica, and Porto
  Rico), Iceland, and perhaps Celebes. The Antilles have been so fully
  discussed and illustrated in my former work, and there is so little fresh
  information about them, that I do not propose to treat of them here,
  especially as they fall short of Madagascar in all points of biological
  interest, and offer no problems of a different character from such as
  have already been sufficiently explained.</p>

  <p>Iceland, also, must apparently be classed as belonging to the "Ancient
  Continental Islands," for though usually described as wholly volcanic, it
  is, more probably, an island of varied geological structure buried under
  the lavas of its numerous volcanoes. But of late years extensive Tertiary
  deposits of Miocene age have been discovered, showing that it is not a
  mere congeries of <!-- Page 451 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page451"></a>{451}</span>volcanoes; it is connected with the
  British Islands and with Greenland by seas less than 500 fathoms deep;
  and it possesses a few mammalia, one of which is peculiar, and at least
  three peculiar species of birds. It was therefore almost certainly united
  with Greenland, and probably with Europe by way of Britain, in the early
  part of the Tertiary period, and thus afforded one of the routes by which
  that intermigration of American and European animals and plants was
  effected which we know occurred during some portion of the Eocene and
  Miocene periods, and probably also in the Pliocene. The fauna and flora
  of this island are, however, so poor, and offer so few peculiarities,
  that it is unnecessary to devote more time to their consideration.</p>

  <p>There remains the great Malay island&mdash;Celebes, which, owing to
  its possession of several large and very peculiar mammalia, must be
  classed, zoologically, as "ancient continental"; but whose central
  position and relations both to Asia and to Australia render it very
  difficult to decide in which of the primary zoological regions it ought
  to be placed, or whether it has ever been united with either of the great
  continents. Although I have pretty fully discussed its zoological
  peculiarities and past history in my <i>Geographical Distribution of
  Animals</i>, it seems advisable to review the facts on the present
  occasion, more especially as the systematic investigation of the
  characteristics of continental islands we have now made will place us in
  a better position for determining its true zoo-geographical
  relations.</p>

  <p><i>Physical Features of Celebes.</i>&mdash;This large and still
  comparatively unexplored island is interesting to the geographer on
  account of its remarkable outline, but much more so to the zoologist for
  its curious assemblage of animal forms. The geological structure of
  Celebes is almost unknown. The extremity of the northern peninsula is
  volcanic; while in the southern peninsula there are extensive deposits of
  a crystalline limestone, in some places overlying basalt. Gold is found
  in the northern peninsula and in the central mass, as well as iron, tin,
  and copper in small quantities; so that there can be little <!-- Page 452
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page452"></a>{452}</span>doubt that the
  mountain ranges of the interior consist of ancient stratified rocks.</p>

    MAP OF CELEBES AND THE SURROUNDING ISLANDS.

    <p class="poem">The depth of sea is shown by three tints: the lightest
    indicating less than 100 fathoms, the medium tint less than 1,000
    fathoms, and the dark tint more than 1,000 fathoms. The figures show
    depths in fathoms.</p>
  </div>

  <p>It is not yet known whether Celebes is completely separated from the
  surrounding islands by a deep sea, but <!-- Page 453 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page453"></a>{453}</span>the facts at our
  command render it probable that it is so. The northern and eastern
  portions of the Celebes Sea have been ascertained to be from 2,000 to
  2,600 fathoms deep, and such depths may extend over a considerable
  portion of it, or even be much exceeded in the centre. In the Molucca
  passage a single sounding on the Gilolo side gave 1,200 fathoms, and a
  large part of the Molucca and Banda Seas probably exceed 2,000 fathoms.
  The southern portion of the Straits of Macassar is full of coral reefs,
  and a shallow sea of less than 100 fathoms extends from Borneo to within
  about forty miles of the western promontory of Celebes; but farther north
  there is deep water close to the shore, and it seems probable that a deep
  channel extends quite through the straits, which have no doubt been much
  shallowed by the deposits from the great Bornean rivers as well as by
  those of Celebes itself. Southward again, the chain of volcanic islands
  from Bali to Timor appears to rise out of a deep ocean, the few soundings
  we possess showing depths of from 670 to 1,300 fathoms almost close to
  their northern shores. We seem justified, therefore, in concluding that
  Celebes is entirely surrounded by a deep sea, which has, however, become
  partially filled up by river deposits, by volcanic upheaval, or by coral
  reefs. Such shallows, where they exist, may therefore be due to antiquity
  and isolation, instead of being indications of a former union with any of
  the surrounding islands.</p>

  <p><i>Zoological Character of the Islands around Celebes.</i>&mdash;In
  order to have a clear conception of the peculiar character of the
  Celebesian fauna, we must take into account that of the surrounding
  countries from which we may suppose it to have received immigrants. These
  we may divide broadly into two groups, those on the west belonging to the
  Oriental region of our zoological geography, and those on the east
  belonging to the Australian region. Of the first group Borneo is a
  typical representative; and from its proximity and the extent of its
  opposing coasts it is the island which we should expect to show most
  resemblance to Celebes. We have already seen that the fauna of Borneo is
  essentially the same as that of Southern Asia, and that it is excessively
  rich in all the Malayan types of <!-- Page 454 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page454"></a>{454}</span>mammalia and birds.
  Java and Bali closely resemble Borneo in general character, though
  somewhat less rich and with several peculiar forms; while the Philippine
  Islands, though very much poorer, and with a greater amount of
  speciality, yet exhibit essentially the same character. These islands,
  taken as a whole, may be described as having a fauna almost identical
  with that of Southern Asia; for no family of mammalia is found in the one
  which is absent from the other, and the same may be said, with very few
  and unimportant exceptions, of the birds; while hundreds of genera and of
  species are common to both.</p>

  <p>In the islands east and south of Celebes&mdash;the Moluccas, New
  Guinea, and the Timor group from Lombok eastward&mdash;we find, on the
  other hand, the most wonderful contrast in the forms of life. Of
  twenty-seven families of terrestrial mammals found in the great Malay
  islands, all have disappeared but four, and of these it is doubtful
  whether two have not been introduced by man. We also find here four
  families of Marsupials, all totally unknown in the western islands. Even
  birds, though usually more widely spread, show a corresponding
  difference, about eleven Malayan families being quite unknown east of
  Celebes, where six new families make their appearance which are equally
  unknown to the westward.<a name="NtA_167"
  href="#Nt_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We have here a radical difference between two sets of islands not very
  far removed from each other, the one set belonging zoologically to Asia,
  the other to Australia. The Asiatic or Malayan group is found to be
  bounded strictly by the eastward limits of the great bank (for the most
  part less than fifty fathoms below the surface) which <!-- Page 455
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page455"></a>{455}</span>stretches out
  from the Siamese and Malayan peninsula as far as Java, Sumatra, Borneo,
  and the Philippines. To the east another bank unites New Guinea and the
  Papuan Islands as far as Aru, Mysol, and Waigiou, with Australia; while
  the Moluccas and Timor groups are surrounded by much deeper water, which
  forms, in the Banda and Celebes Seas and perhaps in other parts of this
  area, great basins of enormous depths (2,000 to 3,000 fathoms or even
  more) enclosed by tracts under a thousand fathoms, which separate the
  basins from each other and from the adjacent Pacific and Indian Oceans
  (see map). This peculiar formation of the sea-bottom probably indicates
  that this area has been the seat of great local upheavals and
  subsidences; and it is quite in accordance with this view that we find
  the Moluccas, while closely agreeing with New Guinea in their forms of
  life, yet strikingly deficient in many important groups, and exhibiting
  an altogether poverty-stricken appearance as regards the higher animals.
  It is a suggestive fact that the Philippine Islands bear an exactly
  parallel relation to Borneo, being equally deficient in many of the
  higher groups; and here too, in the Sooloo Sea, we find a similar
  enclosed basin of great depth. Hence we may in both cases connect, on the
  one hand, the extensive area of land-surface and of adjacent shallow sea
  with a long period of stability and a consequent rich development of the
  forms of life; and, on the other hand, a highly broken land-surface with
  the adjacent seas of great but very unequal depths, with a period of
  disturbance, probably involving extensive submersions of the land,
  resulting in a scanty and fragmentary vertebrate fauna.</p>

  <p><i>Zoology of Celebes.</i>&mdash;The zoology of Celebes differs so
  remarkably from that of both the great divisions of the Archipelago above
  indicated, that it is very difficult to decide in which to place it. It
  possesses only about sixteen species of terrestrial mammalia, so that it
  is at once distinguished from Borneo and Java by its extreme poverty in
  this class. Of this small number four belong to the Moluccan and
  Australian fauna&mdash;there being two marsupials of the genus Cuscus,
  and two forest rats said to be allied to Australian types. <!-- Page 456
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page456"></a>{456}</span></p>

  <p>The remaining twelve species are, generally speaking, of Malayan or
  Asiatic types, but some of them are so peculiar that they have no near
  allies in any part of the world; while the rest are of the ordinary Malay
  type or even identical with Malayan species, and some of these may be
  recent introductions through human agency. These twelve species of
  Asiatic type will be now enumerated. They consist of five peculiar
  squirrels&mdash;a group unknown farther east; a peculiar species of wild
  pig; a deer so closely allied to the <i>Cervus hippelaphus</i> of Borneo
  that it may well have been introduced by man both here and in the
  Moluccas; a civet, <i>Viverra tangalunga</i>, common in all the Malay
  Islands, and also perhaps introduced; the curious Malayan tarsier
  (<i>Tarsius spectrum</i>) said to be only found in a small island off the
  coast;&mdash;and besides these, three remarkable animals, all of large
  size and all quite unlike anything found in the Malay Islands or even in
  Asia. These are a black and almost tailless baboon-like ape (<i><span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `Cynopitheus'."
  >Cynopithecus</span> nigrescens</i>); an antelopean buffalo (<i>Anoa
  depressicornis</i>), and the strange babirusa (<i>Babirusa
  alfurus</i>).</p>

  <p>None of these three animals last mentioned has any close allies
  elsewhere, and their presence in Celebes may be considered the crucial
  fact which must give us the clue to the past history of the island. Let
  us then see what they teach us. The ape is apparently somewhat
  intermediate between the great baboons of Africa and the short-tailed
  macaques of Asia, but its cranium shows a nearer approach to the former
  group, in its flat projecting muzzle, large superciliary crests, and
  maxillary ridges. The anoa, though anatomically allied to the buffaloes,
  externally more resembles the bovine antelopes of Africa; while the
  babirusa is altogether unlike any other living member of the swine
  family, the canines of the upper jaws growing directly upwards like
  horns, forming a spiral curve over the eyes, instead of downwards, as in
  all other mammalia. An approach to this peculiarity is made by the
  African wart-hogs, in which the upper tusk grows out laterally and then
  curves up; but these animals are not otherwise closely allied to the
  babirusa. <!-- Page 457 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page457"></a>{457}</span></p>

  <p><i>Probable Derivation of the Mammals of Celebes.</i>&mdash;It is
  clear that we have here a group of extremely peculiar, and, in all
  probability, very ancient forms, which have been preserved to us by
  isolation in Celebes, just as the monotremes and marsupials have been
  preserved in Australia, and so many of the lemurs and Insectivora in
  Madagascar. And this compels us to look upon the existing island as a
  fragment of some ancient land, once perhaps forming part of the great
  northern continent, but separated from it far earlier than Borneo,
  Sumatra, and Java. The exceeding scantiness of the mammalian fauna,
  however, remains to be accounted for. We have seen that Formosa, a much
  smaller island, contains more than twice as many species; and we may be
  sure that at the time when such animals as apes and buffaloes existed,
  the Asiatic continent swarmed with varied forms of mammals to quite as
  great an extent as Borneo does now. If the portion of separated land had
  been anything like as large as Celebes now is, it would certainly have
  preserved a far more abundant and varied fauna. To explain the facts we
  have the choice of two theories:&mdash;either that the original island
  has since its separation been greatly reduced by submersion, so as to
  lead to the extinction of most of the higher land animals; or, that it
  originally formed part of an independent land stretching eastward, and
  was only united with the Asiatic continent for a short period, or perhaps
  even never united at all, but so connected by intervening islands
  separated by narrow straits that a few mammals might find their way
  across. The latter supposition appears best to explain the facts. The
  three animals in question are such as might readily pass over narrow
  straits from island to island; and we are thus better enabled to
  understand the complete absence of the arboreal monkeys, of the
  Insectivora, and of the very numerous and varied Carnivora and Rodents of
  Borneo, all of which except the squirrels are entirely unrepresented in
  Celebes by any peculiar and ancient forms.</p>

  <p>The question at issue can only be finally determined by geological
  investigations. If Celebes has once formed part of Asia, and participated
  in its rich mammalian fauna, which has been since destroyed by
  submergence, then some <!-- Page 458 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page458"></a>{458}</span>remains of this fauna must certainly be
  preserved in caves or late Tertiary deposits, and proofs of the
  submergence itself will be found when sought for. If, on the other hand,
  the existing animals fairly represent those which have ever reached the
  island, then no such remains will be discovered, and there need be no
  evidence of any great and extensive subsidence in late Tertiary
  times.</p>

  <p><i>Birds of Celebes.</i>&mdash;Having thus clearly placed before us
  the problem presented by the mammalian fauna of Celebes, we may proceed
  to see what additional evidence is afforded by the birds and any other
  groups of which we have sufficient information. About 164 species of true
  land-birds are now known to inhabit the island of Celebes itself.
  Considerably more than half of these (ninety-four species) are peculiar
  to it; twenty-nine are found also in Borneo and the other Malay Islands,
  to which they specially belong; while sixteen are common to the Moluccas
  or other islands of the Australian region; the remainder being species of
  wide range and not characteristic of either division of the Archipelago.
  We have here a large preponderance of western over eastern species of
  birds inhabiting Celebes, though not to quite so great an extent as in
  the mammalia; and the inference to be drawn from this fact is, simply,
  that more birds have migrated from Borneo than from the
  Moluccas&mdash;which is exactly what we might expect both from the
  greater extent of the coast of Borneo opposite that of Celebes, and also
  from the much greater richness in species of the Bornean than the
  Moluccan bird-fauna.</p>

  <p>It is, however, to the relations of the peculiar species of Celebesian
  birds that we must turn, in order to ascertain the origin of the fauna in
  past times; and we must look to the source of the generic types which
  they represent to give us this information. The ninety-four peculiar
  species above noted belong to about sixty-six genera, of which about
  twenty-three are common to the whole Archipelago, and have therefore
  little significance. Of the remainder, twelve are altogether peculiar to
  Celebes; twenty-one are Malayan, but not Moluccan or Australian; while
  ten are Moluccan or Australian, but not Malayan. This <!-- Page 459
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page459"></a>{459}</span>proportion
  does not differ much from that afforded by the non-peculiar species; and
  it teaches us that, for a considerable period, Celebes has been receiving
  immigrants from all sides, many of which have had time to become modified
  into distinct representative species. These evidently belong to the
  period during which Borneo on the one side, and the Moluccas on the
  other, have occupied very much the same relative position as now. There
  remain the twelve peculiar Celebesian genera, to which we must look for
  some further clue as to the origin of the older portion of the fauna; and
  as these are especially interesting we must examine them somewhat
  closely.</p>

  <p><i>Bird-types Peculiar to Celebes.</i>&mdash;First we have Artamides,
  one of the Campephaginæ or caterpillar-shrikes&mdash;a not very
  well-marked genus, and which may have been derived, either from the
  Malayan or the Moluccan side of the Archipelago. Two peculiar genera of
  kingfishers&mdash;Monachalcyon and Cittura&mdash;seem allied, the former
  to the widespread Todiramphus and to the Caridonax of Lombok, the latter
  to the Australian Melidora. Another kingfisher, Ceycopsis, combines the
  characters of the Malayan Ceyx and the African Ispidina, and thus forms
  an example of an ancient generalised form analogous to what occurs among
  the mammalia. Streptocitta is a peculiar form allied to the magpies;
  while Basilornis (found also in Ceram), Enodes, and Scissirostrum, are
  very peculiar starlings, the latter altogether unlike any other bird, and
  perhaps forming a distinct sub-family. Meropogon is a peculiar bee-eater,
  allied to the Malayan Nyctiornis; Rhamphococyx is a modification of
  Phænicophaes, a Malayan genus of cuckoos; Prioniturus (found also in the
  Philippines) is a genus of parrots distinguished by raquet-formed tail
  feathers, altogether unique in the order; while Megacephalon is a
  remarkable and very isolated form of the Australian Megapodiidæ, or
  mound-builders.</p>

  <p>Omitting those whose affinity may be pretty clearly traced to groups
  still inhabiting the islands of the western or the eastern half of the
  Archipelago, we find four birds which have no near allies at all, but
  appear to be either ancestral forms, or extreme modifications, of Asiatic
  or <!-- Page 460 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page460"></a>{460}</span>African birds&mdash;Basilornis, Enodes,
  Scissirostrum, Ceycopsis. These may fairly be associated with the
  baboon-ape, anoa, and babirusa, as indicating extreme antiquity and some
  communication with the Asiatic continent at a period when the forms of
  life and their geographical distribution differed considerably from what
  they are at the present time.</p>

  <p>But here again we meet with exactly the same difficulty as in the
  mammalia, in the comparative poverty of the types of birds now inhabiting
  Celebes. Although the preponderance of affinity, especially in the case
  of its more ancient and peculiar forms, is undoubtedly with Asia rather
  than with Australia; yet, still more decidedly than in the case of the
  mammalia, are we forbidden to suppose that it ever formed a part of the
  old Asiatic continent, on account of the <i>total</i> absence of so many
  important and extensive groups of Asiatic birds. It is not single species
  or even genera, but whole families that are thus absent, and among them
  families which are pre-eminently characteristic of all tropical Asia.
  Such are the Timaliidæ, or babblers, of which there are twelve genera in
  Borneo, and nearly thirty genera in the Oriental Region, but of which one
  species only, hardly distinguishable from a Malayan form, inhabits
  Celebes; the Phyllornithidæ, or green bulbuls, and the Pycnonotidæ, or
  bulbuls, both absolutely ubiquitous in tropical Asia and Malaya, but
  unknown in Celebes; the Eurylæmidæ, or gapers, found everywhere in the
  great Malay Islands; the Megalæmidæ, or barbets; the Trogonidæ, or
  trogons; and the Phasianidæ, or pheasants, all pre-eminently Asiatic and
  Malayan but all absent from Celebes, with the exception of the common
  jungle-fowl, which, owing to the passion of Malays for cock-fighting, may
  have been introduced. To these important <i>families</i> may be added
  Asiatic and Malayan <i>genera</i> by the score; but, confining ourselves
  to these seven ubiquitous families, we must ask,&mdash;Is it possible,
  that, at the period when the ancestors of the peculiar Celebes mammals
  entered the island, and when the forms of life, though distinct, could
  not have been quite unlike those now living, it could have actually
  formed a part of the continent without <!-- Page 461 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page461"></a>{461}</span>possessing
  representatives of the greater part of these extensive and important
  families of birds? To get rid altogether of such varied and dominant
  types of bird-life by any subsequent process of submersion is more
  difficult than to exterminate mammalia; and we are therefore again driven
  to our former conclusion&mdash;that the present land of Celebes has never
  (in Tertiary times) been united to the Asiatic continent, but has
  received its population of Asiatic forms by migration across narrow
  straits and intervening islands. Taking into consideration the amount of
  affinity on the one hand, and the isolation on the other, of the
  Celebesian fauna, we may probably place the period of this earlier
  migration in the early part of the latter half of the Tertiary period,
  that is, in middle or late Miocene times.</p>

  <p><i>Celebes not Strictly a Continental Island.</i>&mdash;A study of the
  mammalian and of the bird-fauna of Celebes thus leads us in both cases to
  the same conclusion, and forbids us to rank it as a strictly continental
  island on the Asiatic side. But facts of a very similar character are
  equally opposed to the idea of a former land-connection with Australia or
  New Guinea, or even with the Moluccas. The numerous marsupials of those
  countries are all wanting in Celebes, except the phalangers of the genus
  Cuscus, and these arboreal creatures are very liable to be carried across
  narrow seas on trees uprooted by earthquakes or floods. The terrestrial
  cassowaries are equally absent; and thus we can account for the presence
  of all the Moluccan or Australian types actually found in Celebes without
  supposing any land-connection on this side during the Tertiary period.
  The presence of the Celebes ape in the island of Batchian, and of the
  babirusa in Bouru, can be sufficiently explained by a somewhat closer
  approximation of the respective lands, or by a few intervening islands
  which have since disappeared, or it may even be due to human agency.</p>

  <p>If the explanation now given of the peculiar features presented by the
  fauna of Celebes be the correct one, we are fully justified in classing
  it as an "anomalous island," since it possesses a small but very
  remarkable mammalian fauna, without ever having been directly united with
  any <!-- Page 462 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page462"></a>{462}</span>continent or extensive land; and, both by
  what it has and what it wants, occupies such an exactly intermediate
  position between the Oriental and Australian regions that it will perhaps
  ever remain a mere matter of opinion with which it should properly be
  associated. Forming, as it does, the western limit of such typical
  Australian groups as the Marsupials among mammalia, and the
  Trichoglossidæ and Meliphagidæ among birds, and being so strikingly
  deficient in all the more characteristic Oriental families and genera of
  both classes, I have always placed it in the Australian Region; but it
  may perhaps with equal propriety be left out of both till a further
  knowledge of its geology enables us to determine its early history with
  more precision.</p>

  <p><i>Peculiarities of the Insects of Celebes.</i>&mdash;The only other
  class of animals in Celebes, of which we have a tolerable knowledge, is
  that of insects, among which we meet with peculiarities of a very
  remarkable kind, and such as are found in no other island on the globe.
  Having already given a full account of some of these peculiarities in a
  paper read before the Linnean Society&mdash;republished in my
  <i>Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection</i>,&mdash;while
  others have been discussed in my <i>Geographical Distribution of
  Animals</i> (Vol. I. p. 434)&mdash;I will only here briefly refer to them
  in order to see whether they accord with, or receive any explanation
  from, the somewhat novel view of the past history of the island here
  advanced.</p>

  <p>The general distribution of the two best known groups of
  insects&mdash;the butterflies and the beetles&mdash;agrees very closely
  with that of the birds and mammalia, inasmuch as Celebes forms the
  eastern limit of a number of Asiatic and Malayan genera, and at the same
  time the western limit of several Moluccan and Australian genera, the
  former perhaps preponderating as in the higher animals.</p>

  <p><i>Himalayan Types of Birds and Butterflies in Celebes.</i>&mdash;A
  curious fact of distribution exhibited both among butterflies and birds,
  is the occurrence in Celebes of species and genera unknown to the
  adjacent islands, but only found again when we reach the Himalayan
  mountains or the Indian Peninsula. Among birds we have a small yellow
  <!-- Page 463 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page463"></a>{463}</span>flycatcher (<i>Myialestes helianthea</i>),
  a flower-pecker (<i>Pachyglossa aureolimbata</i>), a finch (<i>Munia
  brunneiceps</i>), and a roller (<i>Coracias temminckii</i>), all closely
  allied to Indian (not Malayan) species,&mdash;all the genera, except
  Munia, being, in fact, unknown in any Malay island. An exactly parallel
  case is that of a butterfly of the genus Dichorrhagia, which has a very
  close ally in the Himalayas, but nothing like it in any intervening
  country. These facts call to mind the similar case of Formosa, where some
  of its birds and mammals occurred again, under identical or closely
  allied forms, in the Himalayas; and in both instances they can only be
  explained by going back to a period when the distribution of these forms
  was very different from what it is now.</p>

  <p><i>Peculiarities of Shape and Colour in Celebesian
  Butterflies.</i>&mdash;Even more remarkable are the peculiarities of
  shape and colour in a number of Celebesian butterflies of different
  genera. These are found to vary all in the same manner, indicating some
  general cause of variation able to act upon totally distinct groups, and
  produce upon them all a common result. Nearly thirty species of
  butterflies, belonging to three different families, have a common
  modification in the shape of their wings, by which they can be
  distinguished at a glance from their allies in any other island or
  country whatever; and all these are larger than the representative forms
  inhabiting most of the adjacent islands.<a name="NtA_168"
  href="#Nt_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a> No such remarkable local modification
  as this is known to occur in any other part of the globe; and whatever
  may have been its cause, that cause must certainly have been long in
  action, and have been confined to a limited area. We have here,
  therefore, another argument in favour of the long-continued isolation of
  Celebes from all the surrounding islands and continents&mdash;a
  hypothesis which we have seen to afford the best, if not the only,
  explanation of its peculiar vertebrate fauna.</p>

  <p><i>Concluding Remarks.</i>&mdash;If the view here given of the origin
  of the remarkable Celebesian fauna is correct, we have in this island a
  fragment of the great eastern <!-- Page 464 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page464"></a>{464}</span>continent which has preserved to us,
  perhaps from Miocene times, some remnants of its ancient animal forms.
  There is no other example on the globe of an island so closely surrounded
  by other islands on every side, yet preserving such a marked
  individuality in its forms of life; while, as regards the special
  features which characterise its insects, it is, so far as yet known,
  absolutely unique. Unfortunately very little is known of the botany of
  Celebes, but it seems probable that its plants will to some extent
  partake of the speciality which so markedly distinguishes its animals;
  and there is here a rich field for any botanist who is able to penetrate
  to the forest-clad mountains of its interior. <!-- Page 465 --><span

</blockquote>

  <p>The fauna of New Zealand has been so recently described, and its
  bearing on the past history of the islands so fully discussed in my large
  work already referred to, that it would not be necessary to introduce the
  subject again, were it not that we now approach it from a somewhat
  different point of view, and with some important fresh material, which
  will enable us to arrive at more definite conclusions as to the nature
  and origin of this remarkable fauna and flora. The present work is,
  besides, addressed to a wider class of readers than my former volumes,
  and it would be manifestly incomplete if all reference to one of the most
  remarkable and interesting of insular faunas was omitted.</p>

  <p>The two great islands which mainly constitute New Zealand are together
  about as large as the kingdom of Italy. They stretch over thirteen
  degrees of latitude in the warmer portion of the south-temperate zone,
  their extreme points corresponding to the latitudes of Vienna and Cyprus.
  Their climate throughout is mild and <!-- Page 472 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page472"></a>{472}</span>equable, their
  vegetation is luxuriant, and deserts or uninhabitable regions are as
  completely unknown as in our own islands.</p>

  <p>The geological structure of these islands has a decidedly continental
  character. Ancient sedimentary rocks, granite, and modern volcanic
  formations abound; gold, silver, copper, tin, iron, and coal are
  plentiful; and there are also some considerable deposits of early or late
  Tertiary age. The Secondary rocks alone are very scantily developed, and
  such fragments as exist are chiefly of Cretaceous age, often not clearly
  separated from the succeeding Eocene beds.</p>

  <p>The position of New Zealand, in the great Southern Ocean, about 1,200
  miles distant from the Australian <!-- Page 473 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page473"></a>{473}</span>continent, is very
  isolated. It is surrounded by a moderately deep ocean; but the form of
  the sea-bottom is peculiar, and may help us in the solution of some of
  the anomalies presented by its living productions. The line of 200
  fathoms encloses the two islands and extends their area considerably; but
  the 1,000-fathom line, which indicates the land-area that would be
  produced if the sea-bottom were elevated 6,000 feet, has a very
  remarkable conformation, extending in a broad mass westward and
  northward, then sending out a great arm reaching to beyond Lord Howe's
  Island. Norfolk Island is situated on a moderate-sized bank, while two
  others, much more extensive, to the north-west approach the great barrier
  reef, which here carries the 1,000-fathom line more than 300 miles from
  the coast. It is probable that a bank, less than 1,500 fathoms below the
  surface, extends over this area, thus forming a connection with tropical
  Australia and New Guinea. Temperate Australia, on the other hand, is
  divided from New Zealand by an oceanic gulf about 700 miles wide and
  between 2,000 and 3,000 fathoms deep. The 2,000-fathom line embraces all
  the islands immediately round New Zealand as far as the Fijis to the
  north, while a submarine plateau at a depth somewhere between one and two
  thousand fathoms stretches southward to the Antarctic continent. Judging
  from these indications, we should say that the most probable ancient
  connections of New Zealand were with tropical Australia, New Caledonia,
  and the Fiji Islands, and perhaps at a still more remote epoch, with the
  great Southern continent by means of intervening lands and islands; and
  we shall find that a land-connection or near approximation in these two
  directions, at remote periods, will serve to explain many of the
  remarkable anomalies which these islands present.</p>

  <p><i>Zoological Character of New Zealand.</i>&mdash;We see, then, that
  both geologically and geographically New Zealand has more of the
  character of a "continental" than of an "oceanic" island, yet its
  zoological characteristics are such as almost to bring it within the
  latter category&mdash;and it is this which gives it its anomalous
  character. It is usually <!-- Page 474 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page474"></a>{474}</span>considered to possess no indigenous
  mammalia; it has no snakes, and only one frog; it possesses (living or
  quite recently extinct) an extensive group of birds incapable of flight;
  and its productions generally are wonderfully isolated, and seem to bear
  no predominant or close relation to those of Australia or any other
  continent. These are the characteristics of an oceanic island; and thus
  we find that the inferences from its physical structure and those from
  its forms of life directly contradict each other. Let us see how far a
  closer examination of the latter will enable us to account for this
  apparent contradiction.</p>

  <p><i>Mammalia of New Zealand.</i>&mdash;The only undoubtedly indigenous
  mammalia appear to be two species of bats, one of which (<i>Scotophilus
  tuberculatus</i>) is, according to Mr. Dobson, identical with an
  Australian form, while the other (<i>Mystacina tuberculata</i>) forms a
  very remarkable and isolated genus of Emballonuridæ, a family which
  extends throughout all the tropical regions of the globe. The genus
  Mystacina was formerly considered to belong to the American
  Phyllostomidæ, but this has been shown to be an error.<a name="NtA_169"
  href="#Nt_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a> The poverty of New Zealand in bats is
  very remarkable when compared with our own islands where there are at
  least twelve distinct species, though we have a far less favourable
  climate.</p>

  <p>Of the existence of truly indigenous land mammals in New Zealand there
  is at present no positive evidence, but there is some reason to believe
  that one if not two species may be found there. The Maoris say that
  before Europeans came to their country a forest-rat abounded and was
  largely used for food. They believe that their ancestors brought it with
  them when they first came to the country; but it has now become almost,
  if not quite, exterminated by the European brown rat. What this native
  animal was is still somewhat doubtful. Several specimens have been caught
  at different times which have been declared by the natives to be the true
  <i>Kiore Maori</i>&mdash;as they term it, but these have usually proved
  on examination to be either the European black rat or some of the native
  Australian rats which now <!-- Page 475 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page475"></a>{475}</span>often find their way on board ships. But
  within the last few years many skulls of a rat have been obtained from
  the old Maori cooking-places, and from a cave associated with moa bones;
  and Captain Hutton, who has examined them, states that they belong to a
  true Mus, but differ from the <i>Mus rattus</i>. This animal might have
  been on the islands when the Maoris first arrived, and in that case would
  be truly indigenous; while the Maori legend of their "ancestors" bringing
  the rat from their Polynesian home may be altogether a myth invented to
  account for its presence in the islands, because the only other land
  mammal which they knew&mdash;the dog&mdash;was certainly so brought. The
  question can only be settled by the discovery of remains of a rat in some
  deposit of an age decidedly anterior to the first arrival of the Maori
  race in New Zealand.<a name="NtA_170"
  href="#Nt_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Much more interesting is the reported existence in the mountains of
  the South Island of a small otter-like animal. Dr. Haast has seen its
  tracks, resembling those of our European otter, at a height of 3,000 feet
  above the sea in a region never before trodden by man; and the animal
  itself was seen by two gentlemen near Lake Heron, about seventy miles due
  west of Christchurch. It was described as being dark brown and the size
  of a large rabbit. On being struck at with a whip, it uttered a shrill
  yelping sound and disappeared in the water.<a name="NtA_171"
  href="#Nt_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a> An animal seen so closely as to be
  struck at with a whip could hardly have been mistaken for a dog&mdash;the
  only other animal that it could possibly be supposed to have been, and a
  dog would certainly not have "disappeared in the water." This account, as
  well as the footsteps, point to an aquatic animal; and if it now
  frequents only the high alpine lakes and streams, this might explain why
  it has never yet been captured. Hochstetter also states that it has a
  native name&mdash;Waitoteke&mdash;a striking evidence of its actual
  existence, while a gentleman who lived many years in the district assures
  me that <!-- Page 476 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page476"></a>{476}</span>it is universally believed in by residents
  in that part of New Zealand. The actual capture of this animal and the
  determination of its characters and affinities could not fail to aid us
  greatly in our speculations as to the nature and origin of the New
  Zealand fauna.<a name="NtA_172" href="#Nt_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Wingless Birds, Living and Extinct.</i>&mdash;Almost equally
  valuable with mammalia in affording indications of geographical changes
  are the wingless birds for which New Zealand is so remarkable. These
  consist of four species of Apteryx, called by the natives
  "kiwis,"&mdash;creatures which hardly look like birds owing to the
  apparent absence (externally) of tail or wings and the dense covering of
  hair-like feathers. They vary in size from that of a small fowl up to
  that of a turkey, and have a long slightly curved bill, somewhat
  resembling that of the snipe or ibis. Two species appear to be confined
  to the South Island, and one to the North Island, but all are becoming
  scarce, and they will no doubt gradually become extinct. These birds are
  generally classed with the Struthiones or ostrich tribe, but they form a
  distinct family, and in many respects differ greatly from all other known
  birds.</p>

  <p>But besides these, a number of other wingless birds, called "moas,"
  inhabited New Zealand during the period of human occupation, and have
  only recently become extinct. These were much larger birds than the
  kiwis, and some of them were even larger than the ostrich, a specimen
  <!-- Page 477 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page477"></a>{477}</span>of <i>Dinornis maximus</i> mounted in the
  British Museum in its natural attitude being eleven feet high. They
  agreed, however, with the living Apteryx in the character of the pelvis
  and some other parts of the skeleton, while in their short bill and in
  some important structural features they resembled the emu of Australia
  and the cassowaries of New Guinea.<a name="NtA_173"
  href="#Nt_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> No less than eleven distinct species
  of these birds have now been discovered; and their remains exist in such
  abundance&mdash;in recent fluviatile deposits, in old native cooking
  places, and even scattered on the surface of the ground&mdash;that
  complete skeletons of several of them have been put together,
  illustrating various periods of growth from the chick up to the adult
  bird. Feathers have also been found attached to portions of the skin, as
  well as the stones swallowed by the birds to assist digestion, and eggs,
  some containing portions of the embryo bird; so that everything confirms
  the statements of the Maoris&mdash;that their ancestors found these birds
  in abundance on the islands, that they hunted them for food, and that
  they finally exterminated them only a short time before the arrival of
  Europeans.<a name="NtA_174" href="#Nt_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> Bones of
  Apteryx are also found fossil, but apparently of the same species as the
  living birds. <!-- Page 478 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page478"></a>{478}</span>How far back in geological time these
  creatures or their ancestral types lived in New Zealand we have as yet no
  evidence to show. Some specimens have been found under a considerable
  depth of fluviatile deposits which may be of Quaternary or even of
  Pliocene age; but this evidently affords us no approximation to the time
  required for the origin and development of such highly peculiar insular
  forms.</p>

  <p><i>Past Changes of New Zealand deduced from its Wingless
  Birds.</i>&mdash;It has been well observed by Captain Hutton, in his
  interesting paper already referred to, that the occurrence of such a
  number of species of Struthious birds living together in so small a
  country as New Zealand is altogether unparalleled elsewhere on the globe.
  This is even more remarkable when we consider that the species are not
  equally divided between the two islands, for remains of no less than ten
  out of the eleven known species of Dinornis have been found in a single
  swamp in the South Island, where also three of the species of Apteryx
  occur. The New Zealand Struthiones, in fact, very nearly equal in number
  those of all the rest of the world, and nowhere else do more than three
  species occur in any one continent or island, while no more than two ever
  occur in the same district. Thus, there appear to be two closely allied
  species of ostriches inhabiting Africa and South-western Asia
  respectively. South America has three species of Rhea, each in a separate
  district. Australia has an eastern and a western variety of emu, and a
  cassowary in the north; while eight other cassowaries are known from the
  islands north of Australia&mdash;one from Ceram, two from the Aru
  Islands, one from Jobie, one from New Britain, and three from New
  Guinea&mdash;but of these last one is confined to the northern and
  another to the southern part of the island.</p>

  <p>This law, of the distribution of allied species in separate
  areas&mdash;which is found to apply more or less accurately to all
  classes of animals&mdash;is so entirely opposed to the crowding together
  of no less that fifteen species of wingless birds in the small area of
  New Zealand, that the idea is at once suggested of great geographical
  changes. Captain Hutton points out that if the islands from Ceram to New
  Britain <!-- Page 479 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page479"></a>{479}</span>were to become joined together, we should
  have a large number of species of cassowary (perhaps several more than
  are yet discovered) in one land area. If now this land were gradually to
  be submerged, leaving a central elevated region, the different species
  would become crowded together in this portion just as the moas and kiwis
  were in New Zealand. But we also require, at some remote epoch, a more or
  less complete union of the islands now inhabited by the separate species
  of cassowaries, in order that the common ancestral form which afterwards
  became modified into these species, could have reached the places where
  they are now found; and this gives us an idea of the complete series of
  changes through which New Zealand is believed to have passed in order to
  bring about its abnormally dense population of wingless birds. First, we
  must suppose a land connection with some country inhabited by struthious
  birds, from which the ancestral forms might be derived; secondly, a
  separation into many considerable islands, in which the various distinct
  species might become differentiated; thirdly, an elevation bringing about
  the union of these islands to unite the distinct species in one area; and
  fourthly, a subsidence of a large part of the area, leaving the present
  islands with the various species crowded together.</p>

  <p>If New Zealand has really gone through such a series of changes as
  here suggested, some proofs of it might perhaps be obtained in the
  outlying islands which were once, presumably, joined with it. And this
  gives great importance to the statement of the aborigines of the Chatham
  Islands, that the Apteryx formerly lived there but was exterminated about
  1835. It is to be hoped that some search will be made here and also in
  Norfolk Island, in both of which it is not improbable remains either of
  Apteryx or Dinornis might be discovered.</p>

  <p>So far we find nothing to object to in the speculations of Captain
  Hutton, with which, on the contrary, we almost wholly concur; but we
  cannot follow him when he goes on to suggest an Antarctic continent
  uniting New Zealand and Australia with South America, and probably also
  with South Africa, in order to explain the existing distribution <!--
  Page 480 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page480"></a>{480}</span>of
  struthious birds. Our best anatomists, as we have seen, agree that both
  Dinornis and Apteryx are more nearly allied to the cassowaries and emus
  than to the ostriches and rheas; and we see that the form of the
  sea-bottom suggests a former connection with North Australia and New
  Guinea&mdash;the very region where these types most abound, and where in
  all probability they originated. The suggestion that all the struthious
  birds of the world sprang from a common ancestor at no very remote
  period, and that their existing distribution is due to direct land
  communication between the countries they <i>now</i> inhabit, is one
  utterly opposed to all sound principles of reasoning in questions of
  geographical distribution. For it depends upon two assumptions, both of
  which are at least doubtful, if not certainly false&mdash;the first, that
  their distribution over the globe has never in past ages been very
  different from what it is now; and the second, that the ancestral forms
  of these birds never had the power of flight. As to the first assumption,
  we have found in almost every case that groups now scattered over two or
  more continents formerly lived in intervening areas of existing land.
  Thus the marsupials of South America and Australia are connected by forms
  which lived in North America and Europe; the camels of Asia and the
  llamas of the Andes had many extinct common ancestors in North America;
  the lemurs of Africa and Asia had their ancestors in Europe, as had the
  trogons of South America, Africa, and tropical Asia. But besides this
  general evidence we have direct proof that the struthious birds had a
  wider range in past times than now. Remains of extinct rheas have been
  found in Central Brazil, and those of ostriches in North India; while
  remains, believed to be of struthious birds, are found in the Eocene
  deposits of England; and the Cretaceous rocks of North America have
  yielded the extraordinary toothed bird, Hesperornis, which Professor O.
  Marsh declares to have been "a carnivorous swimming ostrich."</p>

  <p>As to the second point, we have the remarkable fact that all known
  birds of this group have not only the rudiments of wing-bones, but also
  the rudiments of wings, that is, an external limb bearing rigid quills or
  largely-developed <!-- Page 481 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page481"></a>{481}</span>plumes. In the cassowary these
  wing-feathers are reduced to long spines like porcupine-quills, while
  even in the Apteryx, the minute external wing bears a series of nearly
  twenty stiff quill-like feathers.<a name="NtA_175"
  href="#Nt_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> These facts render it almost certain
  that the struthious birds do not owe their imperfect wings to a direct
  evolution from a reptilian type, but to a retrograde development from
  some low form of winged birds, analogous to that which has produced the
  dodo and the solitaire from the more highly-developed pigeon-type.
  Professor Marsh has proved, that so far back as the Cretaceous period,
  the two great forms of birds&mdash;those with a keeled sternum and
  fairly-developed wings, and those with a convex keel-less sternum and
  rudimentary wings&mdash;already existed side by side; while in the still
  earlier Archæopteryx of the Jurassic period we have a bird with
  well-developed wings, and therefore probably with a keeled sternum. We
  are evidently, therefore, very far from a knowledge of the earliest
  stages of bird life, and our acquaintance with the various forms that
  have existed is scanty in the extreme; but we may be sure that birds
  acquired wings, and feathers, and some power of flight, before they
  developed a keeled sternum, since we see that bats with no such keel fly
  very well. Since, therefore, the struthious birds all have perfect
  feathers, and all have rudimentary wings, which are anatomically those of
  true birds, not the rudimentary fore-legs of reptiles, and since we know
  that in many higher groups of birds&mdash;as the pigeons and the
  rails&mdash;the wings have become more or less aborted, and the keel of
  the sternum greatly reduced in size by disuse, it seems probable that the
  very remote ancestors of the rhea, the cassowary, and the apteryx, were
  true flying birds, although not perhaps provided with a keeled sternum,
  or possessing very great powers of flight. But in addition to the
  possible ancestral power of flight, we have the undoubted fact that the
  rhea and the emu both swim freely, the former having been seen swimming
  from island to island off the coast of Patagonia. This, taken in
  connection with the wonderful aquatic ostrich of the Cretaceous period
  discovered by Professor Marsh, opens <!-- Page 482 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page482"></a>{482}</span>up fresh possibilities
  of migration; while the immense antiquity thus given to the group and
  their universal distribution in past time, renders all suggestions of
  special modes of communication between the parts of the globe in which
  their scattered remnants <i>now</i> happen to exist, altogether
  superfluous and misleading.</p>

  <p>The bearing of this argument on our present subject is, that so far as
  accounting for the presence of wingless birds in New Zealand is
  concerned, we have nothing whatever to do with any possible connection,
  by way of a southern continent or antarctic islands, with South America
  and South Africa, because the nearest allies of its moas and kiwis are
  the cassowaries and emus, and we have distinct indications of a former
  land extension towards North Australia and New Guinea, which is exactly
  what we require for the original entrance of the struthious type into the
  New Zealand area.</p>

  <p><i>Winged Birds and Lower Vertebrates of New Zealand.</i>&mdash;Having
  given a pretty full account of the New Zealand fauna elsewhere<a
  name="NtA_176" href="#Nt_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a> I need only here point
  out its bearing on the hypothesis now advanced, of the former
  land-connection having been with North Australia, New Guinea, and the
  Western Pacific Islands, rather than with the temperate regions of
  Australia.</p>

  <p>Of the Australian genera of birds, which are found also in New
  Zealand, almost every one ranges also into New Guinea or the Pacific
  Islands, while the few that do not extend beyond Australia are found in
  its northern districts. As regards the peculiar New Zealand genera, all
  whose affinities can be traced are allied to birds which belong to the
  tropical parts of the Australian region; while the starling family, to
  which four of the most remarkable New Zealand birds belong (the genera
  Creadion, Heterolocha, and Callæas), is totally wanting in temperate
  Australia and is comparatively scarce in the entire Australian region,
  but is abundant in the Oriental region, with which New Guinea and the
  Moluccas are in easy communication. It is certainly a most suggestive
  fact that there are more than sixty <!-- Page 483 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page483"></a>{483}</span>genera of birds
  peculiar to the Australian continent (with Tasmania), many of them almost
  or quite confined to its temperate portions, and that no single one of
  these should be represented in temperate New Zealand.<a name="NtA_177"
  href="#Nt_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> The affinities of the living and more
  highly organised, no less than those of the extinct and wingless birds,
  strikingly accord with the line of communication indicated by the deep
  submarine bank connecting these temperate islands with the tropical parts
  of the Australian region.</p>

  <p>The reptiles, so far as they go, are quite in accordance with the
  birds. The lizards belong to two genera, Lygosoma, which has a wide range
  in all the tropics as well as in Australia; and Naultinus, a genus
  peculiar to New Zealand, but belonging to a
  family&mdash;Geckonidæ&mdash;spread over the whole of the warmer parts of
  the world. Australia, with New Guinea, on the other hand, has a peculiar
  family, and no less than twenty-one peculiar genera of lizards, many of
  which are confined to its temperate regions, but no one of them extends
  to temperate New Zealand.<a name="NtA_178"
  href="#Nt_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> The extraordinary lizard-like
  <i>Hatteria punctata</i> of New Zealand forms of itself a distinct order
  of reptiles, in some respects intermediate between lizards and
  crocodiles, and having therefore no affinity with any living animal.</p>

  <p>The only representative of the Amphibia in New Zealand is a solitary
  frog of a peculiar genus (<i>Liopelma hochstetteri</i>); but it has no
  affinity for any of the Australian frogs, which are numerous, and belong
  to eleven different families; while the Liopelma belongs <!-- Page 484
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page484"></a>{484}</span>to a very
  distinct family (Discoglossidæ), confined to the Palæarctic region.</p>

  <p>Of the fresh-water fishes we need only say here, that none belong to
  peculiar Australian types, but are related to those of temperate South
  America or of Asia.</p>

  <p>The Invertebrate classes are comparatively little known, and their
  modes of dispersal are so varied and exceptional that the facts presented
  by their distribution can add little weight to those already adduced. We
  will, therefore, now proceed to the conclusions which can fairly be drawn
  from the general facts of New Zealand natural history already known to
  us.</p>

  <p><i>Deductions from the Peculiarities of the New Zealand
  Fauna.</i>&mdash;The total absence (or extreme scarcity) of mammals in
  New Zealand obliges us to place its union with North Australia and New
  Guinea at a very remote epoch. We must either go back to a time when
  Australia itself had not yet received the ancestral forms of its present
  marsupials and monotremes, or we must suppose that the portion of
  Australia with which New Zealand was connected was then itself isolated
  from the mainland, and was thus without a mammalian population. We shall
  see in our next chapter that there are certain facts in the distribution
  of plants, no less than in the geological structure of the country, which
  favour the latter view. But we must on any supposition place the union
  very far back, to account for the total want of identity between the
  winged birds of New Zealand and those peculiar to Australia, and a
  similar want of accordance in the lizards, the fresh-water fishes, and
  the more important insect-groups of the two countries. From what we know
  of the long geological duration of the generic types of these groups we
  must certainly go back to the earlier portion of the Tertiary period at
  least, in order that there should be such a complete disseverance as
  exists between the characteristic animals of the two countries; and we
  must further suppose that, since their separation, there has been no
  subsequent union or sufficiently near approach to allow of any important
  intermigration, even of winged birds, between them. It seems probable,
  therefore, that <!-- Page 485 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page485"></a>{485}</span>the Bampton shoal west of New Caledonia,
  and Lord Howe's Island further south, formed the western limits of that
  extensive land in which the great wingless birds and other isolated
  members of the New Zealand fauna were developed. Whether this early land
  extended eastward to the Chatham Islands and southward to the Macquaries
  we have no means of ascertaining, but as the intervening sea appears to
  be not more than about 1,500 fathoms deep it is quite possible that such
  an amount of subsidence may have occurred. It is possible, too, that
  there may have been an extension northward to the Kermadec Islands, and
  even further to the Tonga and Fiji Islands, though this is hardly
  probable, or we should find more community between their productions and
  those of New Zealand.</p>

  <p>A southern extension towards the Antarctic continent at a somewhat
  later period seems more probable, as affording an easy passage for the
  numerous species of South American and Antarctic plants, and also for the
  identical and closely allied fresh-water fishes of these countries.</p>

  <p>The subsequent breaking up of this extensive land into a number of
  separate islands in which the distinct species of moa and kiwi were
  developed&mdash;their union at a later period, and the final submergence
  of all but the existing islands, is a pure hypothesis, which seems
  necessary to explain the occurrence of so many species of these birds in
  a small area but of which we have no independent proof. There are,
  however, some other facts which would be explained by it, as the presence
  of three peculiar but allied genera of starlings, the three species of
  parrots of the genus Nestor, and the six distinct rails of the genus
  Ocydromus, as well as the numerous species in some of the peculiar New
  Zealand genera of plants, which seem less likely to have been developed
  in a single area than when isolated, and thus preserved from the
  counteracting influence of intercrossing.</p>

  <p>In the present state of our knowledge these seem all the conclusions
  we can arrive at from a study of the New Zealand fauna; but as we
  fortunately possess a tolerably <!-- Page 486 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page486"></a>{486}</span>full and accurate knowledge of the flora
  of New Zealand, as well as of that of Australia and the south temperate
  lands generally, it will be well to see how far these conclusions are
  supported by the facts of plant distribution, and what further
  indications they afford us of the early history of these most interesting
  countries. This inquiry is of sufficient importance to occupy a separate
  chapter.</p>

  <p>Although plants have means of dispersal far exceeding those possessed
  by animals, yet as a matter of fact comparatively few species are carried
  for very great distances, and the flora of a country taken as a whole
  usually affords trustworthy indications of its past history. Plants, too,
  are more numerous in species than the higher animals, and are almost
  always better known; their affinities have been more systematically
  studied; and it may be safely affirmed that no explanation of the origin
  of the fauna of a country can be sound, which does not also explain, or
  at least harmonise with, the distribution and relations of its flora. The
  distribution of the two may be very different, but both should be
  explicable by the same series of geographical changes.</p>

  <p>The relations of the flora of New Zealand to that of Australia have
  long formed an insoluble enigma for <!-- Page 488 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page488"></a>{488}</span>botanists. Sir Joseph
  Hooker, in his most instructive and masterly essay on the flora of
  Australia, says:&mdash;"Under whatever aspect I regard the flora of
  Australia and of New Zealand, I find all attempts to theorise on the
  possible causes of their community of feature frustrated by anomalies in
  distribution, such as I believe no two other similarly situated countries
  in the globe present. Everywhere else I recognise a parallelism or
  harmony in the main common features of contiguous floras, which conveys
  the impression of their generic affinity, at least, being affected by
  migration from centres of dispersion in one of them, or in some adjacent
  country. In this case it is widely different. Regarding the question from
  the Australian point of view, it is impossible in the present state of
  science to reconcile the fact of Acacia, Eucalyptus, Casuarina,
  Callitris, &amp;c., being absent in New Zealand, with any theory of
  transoceanic migration that may be adopted to explain the presence of
  other Australian plants in New Zealand; and it is very difficult to
  conceive of a time or of conditions that could explain these anomalies,
  except by going back to epochs when the prevalent botanical as well as
  geographical features of each were widely different from what they are
  now. On the other hand, if I regard the question from the New Zealand
  point of view, I find such broad features of resemblance, and so many
  connecting links that afford irresistible evidence of a close botanical
  connection, that I cannot abandon the conviction that these great
  differences will present the least difficulties to whatever theory may
  explain the whole case." I will now state, as briefly as possible, what
  are the facts above referred to as being of so anomalous a character, and
  there is little difficulty in doing so, as we have them fully set forth,
  with admirable clearness, in the essay above alluded to, and in the same
  writer's <i>Introduction to the Flora of New Zealand</i>, only requiring
  some slight modifications, owing to the later discoveries which are given
  in the <i>Handbook of the New Zealand Flora</i>.</p>

  <p>Confining ourselves always to flowering plants, we find that the flora
  of New Zealand is a very poor one, considering the extent of surface, and
  the favourable conditions of <!-- Page 489 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page489"></a>{489}</span>soil and climate. It consists of 1,085
  species (our own islands possessing about 1,500), but a very large
  proportion of these are peculiar, there being no less than 800 endemic
  species, and thirty-two endemic genera.</p>

  <p>Out of the 285 species not peculiar to New Zealand, no less than 215
  are Australian, but a considerable number of these are also Antarctic,
  South American, or European; so that there are only about 100
  <i>species</i> absolutely confined to New Zealand and Australia, and,
  what is important as indicating a somewhat recent immigration, only some
  half-dozen of these belong to <i>genera</i> which are peculiar to the two
  countries, and hardly any to the larger and more important Australian
  genera. Many, too, are rare species in both countries and are often
  alpines.</p>

  <p>Far more important are the relations of the genera and families of the
  two countries. All the Natural Orders of New Zealand are found in
  Australia except three&mdash;Coriariæ, a widely-scattered group found in
  South Europe, the Himalayas, and the Andes; Escallonieæ, a widely
  distributed group; and Chloranthaceæ, found in Tropical Asia, Japan,
  Polynesia, and South America. Out of a total of 310 New Zealand genera,
  no less than 248 are Australian, and sixty of these are almost peculiar
  to the two countries, only thirty-two however being absolutely confined
  to them.<a name="NtA_179" href="#Nt_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a> In the
  three large orders&mdash;Compositæ, Orchideæ, and Gramineæ, the genera
  are almost identical in the two countries, while the species&mdash;in the
  two former especially&mdash;are mostly distinct.</p>

  <p>Here then we have apparently a wonderful resemblance between the New
  Zealand flora and that of Australia, indicated by more than two-thirds of
  the non-peculiar species, and more than nine-tenths of the non-peculiar
  genera (255) being Australian. But now let us look at the other side of
  the question.</p>

  <p>There are in Australia seven great genera of plants, each containing
  more than 100 species, all widely spread over <!-- Page 490 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page490"></a>{490}</span>the country, and all
  highly characteristic Australian forms,&mdash;Acacia, Eucalyptus,
  Melaleuca, Leucopogon, Stylidium, Grevillea, and Hakea. These are
  entirely absent from New Zealand, except one species of Leucopogon, a
  genus which also has representatives in the Malayan and Pacific Islands.
  Sixteen more Australian genera have over fifty species each, and of these
  eight are totally absent from New Zealand, five are represented by one or
  two species, and only two are fairly represented; but these
  two&mdash;Drosera and Helichrysum&mdash;are very widespread genera, and
  might have reached New Zealand from other countries than Australia.</p>

  <p>But this by no means exhausts the differences between New Zealand and
  Australia. No less than seven Australian Natural
  Orders&mdash;Dilleniaceæ, Buettneriaceæ, Polygaleæ, Tremandreæ,
  Casuarineæ, Hæmodoraceæ, and Xyrideæ are entirely wanting in New Zealand,
  and several others which are excessively abundant and highly
  characteristic of the former country are very poorly represented in the
  latter. Thus, Leguminosæ are extremely abundant in Australia, where there
  are over 1,000 species belonging to about 100 genera, many of them
  altogether peculiar to the country; yet in New Zealand this great order
  is most scantily represented, there being only five genera and thirteen
  species; and only two of these genera, Swainsonia and Clianthus, are
  Australian, and as the latter consists of but two species it may as well
  have passed from New Zealand to Australia as the other way, or more
  probably from some third country to them both.<a name="NtA_180"
  href="#Nt_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a> Goodeniaceæ with ten genera and 220
  species Australian, has but two species in New Zealand&mdash;and one of
  these is a salt-marsh plant found also in Tasmania and in Chile; and four
  other large Australian orders&mdash;Rhamneæ, Myoporineæ, Proteaceæ and
  Santalaceæ, have very few representatives in New Zealand.</p>

  <p>We find, then, that the great fact we have to explain and account for
  is, the undoubted affinity of the New <!-- Page 491 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page491"></a>{491}</span>Zealand flora to that
  of Australia, but an affinity almost exclusively confined to the least
  predominant and least peculiar portion of that flora, leaving the most
  predominant, most characteristic, and most widely distributed portion
  absolutely unrepresented. We must however be careful not to exaggerate
  the amount of affinity with Australia, apparently implied by the fact
  that nearly six-sevenths of the New Zealand genera are also Australian,
  for, as we have already stated, a very large number of these are
  European, Antarctic, South American or Polynesian genera, whose presence
  in the two contiguous areas only indicates a common origin. About
  one-eighth, only, are absolutely confined to Australia and New Zealand
  (thirty-two genera), and even of these several are better represented in
  New Zealand than in Australia, and may therefore have passed from the
  former to the latter. No less than 174 of the New Zealand genera are
  temperate South American, many being also Antarctic or European; while
  others again are especially tropical or Polynesian; yet undoubtedly a
  larger proportion of the Natural Orders and genera are common to
  Australia than to any other country, so that we may say that the basis of
  the flora is Australian with a large intermixture of northern and
  southern temperate forms and others which have remote world-wide
  affinities.</p>

  <p><i>General Features of the Australian Flora and its Probable
  Origin.</i>&mdash;Before proceeding to point out how the peculiarities of
  the New Zealand flora may be best accounted for, it is necessary to
  consider briefly what are the main peculiarities of Australian
  vegetation, from which so important a part of that of New Zealand has
  evidently been derived.</p>

  <p>The actual Australian flora consists of two great divisions&mdash;a
  temperate and a tropical, the temperate being again divisible into an
  eastern and a western portion. All that is most characteristic of the
  Australian flora belongs to the temperate division (though these often
  overspread the whole continent), in which are found almost all the
  remarkable Australian types of vegetation and the numerous genera
  peculiar to this part of the world. Contrary to what occurs in most other
  countries, the <!-- Page 492 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page492"></a>{492}</span>tropical appears to be less rich in
  species and genera than the temperate region, and what is still more
  remarkable it contains fewer peculiar species, and very few peculiar
  genera. Although the area of tropical Australia is about equal to that of
  the temperate portions, and it has now been pretty well explored
  botanically, it has probably not more than half as many species.<a
  name="NtA_181" href="#Nt_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a> Nearly 500 of its
  species are identical with Indian or Malayan plants, or are very close
  representatives of them; while there are more than 200 Indian genera,
  confined for the most part to the tropical portion of Australia. The
  remainder of the tropical flora consists of a few species and many genera
  of temperate <!-- Page 493 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page493"></a>{493}</span>Australia which range over the whole
  continent, but these form only a small portion of the peculiarly
  Australian genera.</p>

  <p>These remarkable facts clearly point to one conclusion&mdash;that the
  flora of tropical Australia is, comparatively, recent and derivative. If
  we imagine the greater part of North Australia to have been submerged
  beneath the ocean, from which it rose in the middle or latter part of the
  Tertiary period, offering an extensive area ready to be covered by such
  suitable forms of vegetation as could first reach it, something like the
  present condition of things would inevitably arise. From the north,
  widespread Indian and Malay plants would quickly enter, while from the
  south the most dominant forms of warm-temperate Australia, and such as
  were best adapted to the tropical climate and arid soil, would
  intermingle with them. Even if numerous islands had occupied the area of
  Northern Australia for long periods anterior to the final elevation, very
  much the same state of things would result.</p>

  <p>The existence in North and North-east Australia of enormous areas
  covered with Cretaceous and other Secondary deposits, as well as
  extensive Tertiary formations, lends support to the view, that during
  very long epochs temperate Australia was cut off from all close
  connection with the tropical and northern lands by a wide extent of sea;
  and this isolation is exactly what was required, in order to bring about
  the wonderful amount of specialisation and the high development
  manifested by the typical Australian flora. Before proceeding further,
  however, let us examine this flora itself, so far as regards its
  component parts and probable past history.</p>

  <p><i>The Floras of South-eastern and South-western
  Australia.</i>&mdash;The peculiarities presented by the south-eastern and
  south-western subdivisions of the flora of temperate Australia are most
  interesting and suggestive, and are, perhaps, unparalleled in any other
  part of the world. South-west Australia is far less extensive than the
  south-eastern division&mdash;less varied in soil and climate, with no
  lofty mountains, and much sandy desert; yet, strange to say, it contains
  an equally rich flora and a far greater proportion of peculiar species
  and genera of plants. As Sir <!-- Page 494 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page494"></a>{494}</span>Joseph Hooker remarks:&mdash;"What
  differences there are in conditions would, judging from analogy with
  other countries, favour the idea that South-eastern Australia, from its
  far greater area, many large rivers, extensive tracts of mountainous
  country and humid forests, would present much the most extensive flora,
  of which only the drier types could extend into South-western Australia.
  But such is not the case; for though the far greater area is much the
  best explored, presents more varied conditions, and is tenanted by a
  larger number of Natural Orders and genera, these contain fewer species
  by several hundreds."<a name="NtA_182"
  href="#Nt_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The fewer genera of South-western Australia are due almost wholly to
  the absence of the numerous European, Antarctic, and South-American types
  found in the south-eastern region, while in purely Australian types it is
  far the richer, for while it contains most of those found in the east it
  has a large number altogether peculiar to it; and Sir Joseph Hooker
  states that "there are about 180 genera, out of 600 in South-western
  Australia, that are either not found at all in South-eastern, or that are
  represented there by a very few species only, and these 180 genera
  include nearly 1,100 species."</p>

  <p><i>Geological Explanation of the Differences of these Two
  Floras.</i>&mdash;These facts again clearly point to the conclusion that
  South-western Australia is the remnant of the more extensive and more
  isolated portion of the continent in which the peculiar Australian flora
  was principally developed. The existence there of a very large area of
  granite&mdash;800 miles in length by nearly 500 in maximum width with
  detached masses 200 miles to the north and 500 miles to the
  east&mdash;indicates such an extension; for these <!-- Page 495 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page495"></a>{495}</span>granitic masses were
  certainly once buried under piles of stratified rock, since denuded, and
  then formed the nucleus of the old Western Australian continent. If we
  take the 1000-fathom line around the southern part of Australia to
  represent the probable extension of this old land we shall see that it
  would give a wide additional area south of the Great Australian Bight,
  and form a continent which, even if the greater part of tropical
  Australia were submerged, would be sufficient for the development of a
  peculiar and abundant flora. We must also remember that an elevation of
  6000 feet, added to the vast amount which has been taken away by
  denudation, would change the whole country, including what are now the
  deserts of the interior, into a mountainous and well-watered region.</p>

  <p>But while this rich and peculiar flora was in process of formation,
  the eastern portion of the continent must either have been widely
  separated from the western or had perhaps not yet risen from the ocean.
  The whole of this part of the country consists of Palæozoic and Secondary
  formations with granite and metamorphic rocks, the Secondary deposits
  being largely developed on both sides of the central range, extending the
  whole length of the continent from Tasmania to Cape York, and
  constituting the greater part of the plateau of the Blue Mountains and
  other lofty ranges. During some portion of the Secondary and Tertiary
  periods therefore, this side of Australia must have been almost wholly
  submerged beneath the ocean; and if we suppose that during this time the
  western part of the continent was at nearly its maximum extent and
  elevation, we shall have a sufficient explanation of the great difference
  between the flora of Western and Eastern Australia, since the latter
  would only have been able to receive immigrants from the former, at a
  later period, and in a more or less fragmentary manner.</p>

  <p>If we examine the geological map of Australia (given in Stanford's
  Compendium of Geography and Travel, volume <i>Australasia</i>), we shall
  see good reason to conclude that the eastern and the western divisions of
  the country first existed as separate islands, and only became united at
  a comparatively recent epoch. This is indicated by an <!-- Page 496
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page496"></a>{496}</span>enormous
  stretch of Cretaceous and Tertiary formations extending from the Gulf of
  Carpentaria completely across the continent to the mouth of the Murray
  River. During the Cretaceous period, therefore, and probably throughout a
  considerable portion of the Tertiary epoch,<a name="NtA_183"
  href="#Nt_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a> there must have been a wide arm of
  the sea occupying this area, dividing the great mass of land on the
  west&mdash;the true seat and origin of the typical Australian
  flora&mdash;from a long but narrow belt of land on the east, indicated by
  the continuous mass of Secondary and Palæozoic formations already
  referred to which extend uninterruptedly from Tasmania to Cape York.
  Whether this formed one continuous land, or was broken up into islands,
  cannot be positively determined; but the fact that no marine Tertiary
  beds occur in the whole of this area, renders it probable that it was
  almost, if not quite, continuous, and that it not improbably extended
  across to what is now New Guinea. At this epoch, then (as shown in the
  accompanying map), Australia may, not improbably, have consisted of a
  very large and fertile western island, almost or quite extratropical, and
  extending from the Silurian rocks of the Flinders range in South
  Australia, to about 150 miles west of the present west coast, and
  southward to about 350 miles south of the Great Australian Bight. To the
  east of this, at a distance of from 250 to 400 miles, extended in a north
  and south direction a long but comparatively narrow island, stretching
  from far south of Tasmania to New Guinea; while the crystalline and
  Secondary formations of central North Australia probably indicate the
  existence of one or more large islands in that direction.</p>

</table>

  <p>The eastern and the western islands&mdash;with which we are now
  chiefly concerned&mdash;would then differ considerably in their
  vegetation and animal life. The western and more ancient land already
  possessed, in its main features, the peculiar Australian flora, and also
  the ancestral forms of its strange marsupial fauna, both of which it had
  probably received at some earlier epoch by a temporary union with the
  Asiatic continent over what is now the Java sea. Eastern Australia, on
  the other hand, possessed only the rudiments of its existing mixed flora,
  derived from three distinct sources. Some important fragments of the
  typical Australian vegetation had reached it across the marine <!-- Page
  498 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page498"></a>{498}</span>strait,
  and had spread widely owing to the soil, climate and general conditions
  being exactly suited to it: from the north and north-east a tropical
  vegetation of Polynesian type had occupied suitable areas in the north;
  while the extension southward of the Tasmanian peninsula, accompanied,
  probably, as now, with lofty mountains, favoured the immigration of
  south-temperate forms from whatever Antarctic lands or islands then
  existed. This supposition is strikingly in harmony with what is known of
  the ancient flora of this portion of Australia. In deposits supposed to
  be of Eocene age in New South Wales and Victoria fossil plants have been
  found showing a very different vegetation from that now existing. Along
  with a few Australian types&mdash;such as Pittosporum, Knightia, and
  Eucalyptus, there occur birches, alders, oaks, and beeches; while in
  Tasmania in freshwater limestone, apparently of Miocene age, are found
  willows, alders, birches, oaks, and beeches,<a name="NtA_184"
  href="#Nt_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a> all except the latter genus (Fagus)
  now quite extinct in Australia.<a name="NtA_185"
  href="#Nt_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a> These temperate forms probably
  indicate a more oceanic climate, cooler and moister than at present. The
  union with Western Australia and the establishment of an arid interior by
  modifying the climate may have led to the extinction of many of these
  forms and their replacement by special Australian types more suited to
  the new conditions.</p>

  <p>At this time the marsupial fauna had not yet reached this eastern
  land, which was, however, occupied in the north by some ancestral
  struthious birds, which had entered it by way of New Guinea through some
  very ancient continental extension, and of which the emu, the
  cassowaries, the extinct Dromornis of Queensland, and the moas and kiwis
  of New Zealand, are the modified descendants.</p>

  <p><i>The Origin of the Australian Element in the New Zealand
  Flora.</i>&mdash;We have now brought down the history of Australia, as
  deduced from its geological structure and the main features of its
  existing and Tertiary flora, to the period <!-- Page 499 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page499"></a>{499}</span>when New Zealand was
  first brought into close connection with it, by means of a great
  north-western extension of that country, which, as already explained in
  our last chapter, is so clearly indicated by the form of the sea bottom
  (See Map, p. <a href="#page471">471</a>). The condition of New Zealand
  previous to this event is very obscure. That it had long existed as a
  more or less extensive land is indicated by its ancient sedimentary
  rocks; while the very small areas occupied by Jurassic and Cretaceous
  deposits, imply that much of the present land was then also above the
  sea-level. The country had probably at that time a scanty vegetation of
  mixed Antarctic and Polynesian origin; but now, for the first time, it
  would be open to the free immigration of such Australian types as were
  suitable to its climate, and which <i>had already reached the tropical
  and sub-tropical portions of the Eastern Australian island</i>. It is
  here that we obtain the clue to those strange anomalies and
  contradictions presented by the New Zealand flora in its relation to
  Australia, which have been so clearly set forth by Sir Joseph Hooker, and
  which have so puzzled botanists to account for. But these apparent
  anomalies cease to present any difficulty when we see that the Australian
  plants in New Zealand were acquired, not directly, but, as it were, at
  second hand, by union with an island which itself had as yet only
  received a portion of its existing flora. And then, further difficulties
  were placed in the way of New Zealand receiving such an adequate
  representation of that portion of the flora which had reached East
  Australia as its climate and position entitled it to, by the fact of the
  union being, not with the temperate, but with the tropical and
  sub-tropical portions of that island, so that only those groups could be
  acquired which were less exclusively temperate, and had already
  established themselves in the warmer portion of their new home.<a
  name="NtA_186" href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 500 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page500"></a>{500}</span></p>

  <p>It is therefore no matter of surprise, but exactly what we should
  expect, that the great mass of pre-eminently temperate Australian genera
  should be absent from New Zealand, including the whole of such important
  families as, Dilleniaceæ, Tremandreæ, Buettneriacæ, Polygaleæ, Casuarineæ
  and Hæmodoraceæ; while others, such as Rutaceæ, Stackhousieæ, Rhamneæ,
  Myrtaceæ, Proteaceæ, and Santalaceæ, are represented by only a few
  species. Thus, too, we can explain the absence of <i>all</i> the peculiar
  Australian Leguminosæ; for these were still mainly confined to the great
  western island, along with the peculiar Acacias and Eucalypti, which at a
  later period spread over the whole continent. It is equally accordant
  with the view we are maintaining, that among the groups which Sir Joseph
  Hooker enumerates as "keeping up the features of extra tropical Australia
  in its tropical quarter," several should have reached New Zealand, such
  as Drosera, some Pittosporeæ and Myoporineæ, with a few Proteaceæ,
  Loganiaceæ, and Restiaceæ; for most of these are not only found in
  tropical Australia, but also in the Malayan and Pacific islands.</p>

  <p><i>Tropical Character of the New Zealand Flora Explained.</i>&mdash;In
  this origin of the New Zealand fauna by a north-western route from
  North-eastern Australia, we find also an explanation of the remarkable
  number of tropical groups of plants found there: for though, as Sir
  Joseph Hooker has <!-- Page 501 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page501"></a>{501}</span>shown, a moist and uniform climate favours
  the extension of tropical forms in the temperate zone, yet some means
  must be afforded them for reaching a temperate island. On carefully going
  through the <i>Handbook</i>, and comparing its indications with those of
  Bentham's <i>Flora Australiensis</i>, I find that there are in New
  Zealand thirty-eight thoroughly tropical genera, thirty-three of which
  are found in Australia&mdash;mostly in the tropical portion of it, though
  a few are temperate, and these may have reached it through New Zealand<a
  name="NtA_187" href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a>. To these we must add
  thirty-two more genera, which, though chiefly developed in temperate
  Australia, extend into the tropical or sub-tropical portions of it, and
  may well have reached New Zealand by the same route.</p>

  <p>On the other hand we find but few New Zealand genera certainly derived
  from Australia which are especially temperate, and it may be as well to
  give a list of such as <!-- Page 502 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page502"></a>{502}</span>do occur with a few remarks. They are
  sixteen in number, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>1. Pennantia (1 sp.). This genus has a species in Norfolk Island,
  indicating perhaps its former extension to the north-west.</p>

  <p>2. Pomaderris (3 sp.). One <i>species</i> inhabits Victoria and New
  Zealand, indicating recent trans-oceanic migration.</p>

  <p>3. Quintinia (2 sp.). This genus has winged seeds facilitating
  migration.</p>

  <p>4. Olearia (20 sp.). Seeds with pappus.</p>

  <p>5. Craspedia (2 sp.). Seeds with pappus. Alpine; identical with
  Australian species, and therefore of comparatively recent
  introduction.</p>

  <p>6. Celmisia (25 sp.). Seeds with pappus. Only three Australian
  species, two of which are identical with New Zealand forms, probably
  therefore derived from New Zealand.</p>

  <p>7. Ozothamnus (5 sp.). Seeds with pappus.</p>

  <p>8. Epacris (4 sp.). Minute seeds. Some species are sub-tropical, and
  they are all found in the northern (warmer) island of New Zealand.</p>

  <p>9. Archeria (2 sp.). Minute seeds. A species common to E. Australia
  and New Zealand.</p>

  <p>10. Logania (3 sp.). Small seeds. Alpine plants.</p>

  <p>11. Hedycarya (1 sp.).</p>

  <p>12. Chiloglottis (1 sp.). Minute seeds. In Auckland Islands; alpine in
  Australia.</p>

  <p>13. Prasophyllum (1 sp.). Minute seeds. Identical with Australian
  species, indicating recent transmission.</p>

  <p>14. Orthoceras (1 sp.). Minute seeds. Identical with an Australian
  species.</p>

  <p>15. Alepyrum (1 sp.). Alpine, moss-like. An Antarctic type.</p>

  <p>16. Dichelachne (3 sp.). Identical with Australian species. An awned
  grass.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We thus see that there are special features in most of these plants
  that would facilitate transmission across the sea between temperate
  Australia and New Zealand, or to both from some Antarctic island; and the
  fact that in several of them the species are absolutely identical shows
  that such transmission has occurred in geologically recent times.</p>

  <p><i>Species Common to New Zealand and Australia Mostly Temperate
  Forms.</i>&mdash;Let us now take the <i>species</i> which are common to
  New Zealand and Australia, but found nowhere else, and which must
  therefore have passed from one country to the other at a more recent
  period than the mass of <i>genera</i> with which we have hitherto been
  dealing. These are ninety-six in number, and they present a striking
  contrast to the similarly restricted <i>genera</i> in being wholly
  temperate in character, the entire list presenting only a <!-- Page 503
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page503"></a>{503}</span>single species
  which is confined to sub-tropical East Australia&mdash;a grass (<i>Apera
  arundinacea</i>) only found in a few localities on the New Zealand
  coast.</p>

  <p>Now it is clear that the larger portion, if not the whole, of these
  plants must have reached New Zealand from Australia (or in a few cases
  Australia from New Zealand), by transmission across the sea, because we
  know there has been no actual land connection during the Tertiary period,
  as proved by the absence of all the Australian mammalia, and almost all
  the most characteristic Australian birds, insects, and plants. The form
  of the sea-bed shows that the distance could not have been less than 600
  miles, even during the greatest extension of Southern New Zealand and
  Tasmania; and we have no reason to suppose it to have been less, because
  in other cases an equally abundant flora of identical species has reached
  islands at a still greater distance&mdash;notably in the case of the
  Azores and Bermuda. The character of the plants is also just what we
  should expect: for about two-thirds of them belong to genera of
  world-wide range in the temperate zones, such as Ranunculus, Drosera,
  Epilobium, Gnaphalium, Senecio, Convolvulus, Atriplex, Luzula, and many
  sedges and grasses, whose exceptionally wide distribution shows that they
  possess exceptional powers of dispersal and vigour of constitution,
  enabling them not only to reach distant countries, but also to establish
  themselves there. Another set of plants belong to especially Antarctic or
  south temperate groups, such as Colobanthus, Acæna, Gaultheria,
  Pernettya, and Muhlenbeckia, and these may in some cases have reached
  both Australia and New Zealand from some now submerged Antarctic island.
  Again, about one-fourth of the whole are alpine plants, and these possess
  two advantages as colonisers. Their lofty stations place them in the best
  position to have their seeds carried away by winds; and they would in
  this case reach a country which, having derived the earlier portion of
  its flora from the side of the tropics, would be likely to have its
  higher mountains and favourable alpine stations to a great extent
  unoccupied, or occupied by plants unable to compete with specially
  adapted alpine groups. <!-- Page 504 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page504"></a>{504}</span></p>

  <p>Fully one-third of the exclusively Australo-New Zealand species belong
  to the two great orders of the sedges and the grasses; and there can be
  no doubt that these have great facilities for dispersion in a variety of
  ways. Their seeds, often enveloped in chaffy glumes, would be carried
  long distances by storms of wind, and even if finally dropped into the
  sea would have so much less distance to reach the land by means of
  surface currents; and Mr. Darwin's experiments show that even cultivated
  oats germinated after 100 days' immersion in sea-water. Others have
  hispid awns by which they would become attached to the feathers of birds,
  and there is no doubt this is an effective mode of dispersal. But a still
  more important point is, probably, that these plants are generally, if
  not always, wind-fertilised, and are thus independent of any peculiar
  insects, which might be wanting in the new country.</p>

  <p><i>Why Easily-Dispersed Plants have often Restricted
  Ranges.</i>&mdash;This last consideration throws light on a very curious
  point, which has been noted as a difficulty by Sir Joseph Hooker, that
  plants which have most clear and decided powers of dispersal by wind or
  other means, have <i>not</i> generally the widest specific range; and he
  instances the small number of Compositæ common to New Zealand and
  Australia. But in all these cases it will, I think, be found that
  although the <i>species</i> have not a wide range the <i>genera</i> often
  have. In New Zealand, for instance, the Compositæ are very abundant,
  there being no less than 167 species, almost all belonging to Australian
  genera, yet only about one-sixteenth of the whole are identical in the
  two countries. The explanation of this is not difficult. Owing to their
  great powers of dispersal, the Australian Compositæ reached New Zealand
  at a very remote epoch, and such as were adapted to the climate and the
  means of fertilisation established themselves; but being highly organised
  plants with great flexibility of organisation, they soon became modified
  in accordance with the new conditions, producing many special forms in
  different localities; and these, spreading widely, soon took possession
  of all suitable stations. Henceforth immigrants from Australia had to
  compete <!-- Page 505 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page505"></a>{505}</span>with these indigenous and well-established
  plants, and only in a few cases were able to obtain a footing; whence it
  arises that we have many Australian types, but few Australian species, in
  New Zealand, and both phenomena are directly traceable to the combination
  of great powers of dispersal with a high degree of adaptability. Exactly
  the same thing occurs with the still more highly specialised Orchideæ.
  These are not proportionally so numerous in New Zealand (thirty-eight
  species), and this is no doubt due to the fact that so many of them
  require insect-fertilisation often by a particular family or genus
  (whereas almost any insect will fertilise Compositæ), and insects of all
  orders are remarkably scarce in New Zealand.<a name="NtA_188"
  href="#Nt_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> This would at once prevent the
  establishment of many of the orchids which may have reached the islands,
  while those which did find suitable fertilisers and other favourable
  conditions would soon become modified into new species. It is thus quite
  intelligible why only three species of orchids are identical in Australia
  and New Zealand, although their minute and abundant seeds must be
  dispersed by the wind almost as readily as the spores of ferns.</p>

  <p>Another specialised group&mdash;the Scrophularineæ&mdash;abounds in
  New Zealand, where there are sixty-two species; but though almost all the
  genera are Australian only three species are so. Here, too, the seeds are
  usually very small, and the powers of dispersal great, as shown by
  several European genera&mdash;Veronica, Euphrasia, and Limosella, being
  found in the southern hemisphere.</p>

  <p>Looking at the whole series of these Australo-New Zealand plants, we
  find the most highly specialised groups&mdash;Compositæ, Scrophularineæ,
  Orchideæ&mdash;with a small proportion of identical species
  (one-thirteenth to one twentieth), the less highly
  specialised&mdash;Ranunculaceæ, Onagrariæ and Ericeæ&mdash;with a higher
  proportion (one-ninth to one-sixth), and the least
  specialised&mdash;Junceæ, <!-- Page 506 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page506"></a>{506}</span>Cyperaceæ and Gramineæ&mdash;with the high
  proportion in each case of one-fourth. These nine are the most important
  New Zealand orders which contain species common to that country and
  Australia and confined to them; and the marked correspondence they show
  between high specialisation and want of <i>specific</i> identity, while
  the <i>generic</i> identity is in all cases approximately equal, points
  to the conclusion that the means of diffusion are, in almost all plants
  ample, when long periods of time are concerned, and that diversities in
  this respect are not so important in determining the peculiar character
  of a derived flora, as adaptability to varied conditions, great powers of
  multiplication, and inherent vigour of constitution. This point will have
  to be more fully discussed in treating of the origin of the Antarctic and
  north temperate members of the New Zealand flora.</p>

  <p><i>Summary and Conclusion on the New Zealand
  Flora.</i>&mdash;Confining ourselves strictly to the direct relations
  between the plants of New Zealand and of Australia, as I have done in the
  preceding discussion, I think I may claim to have shown that the union
  between the two countries in the latter part of the Secondary epoch at a
  time when Eastern Australia was widely separated from Western Australia
  (as shown by its geological formation and by the contour of the
  sea-bottom) does sufficiently account for all the main features of the
  New Zealand flora. It shows why the basis of the flora is fundamentally
  Australian both as regards orders and genera, for it was due either to a
  direct land connection or a somewhat close approximation between the two
  countries. It shows also why the great mass of typical Australian forms
  are unrepresented, for the Australian flora is typically <i>western</i>
  and <i>temperate</i>, and New Zealand received its immigrants from the
  <i>eastern</i> island which had itself received only a fragment of this
  flora, and from the <i>tropical</i> end of this island, and thus could
  only receive such forms as were not exclusively temperate in character.
  It shows, further, why New Zealand contains such a very large proportion
  of tropical forms, for we see that it derived the main portion of its
  flora directly from the tropics. Again, this hypothesis shows us why,
  though <!-- Page 507 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page507"></a>{507}</span>the specially Australian <i>genera</i> in
  New Zealand are largely tropical or sub-tropical, the specially
  Australian <i>species</i> are wholly temperate or alpine; for these are
  comparatively recent arrivals, they must have migrated across the sea in
  the temperate zone, and these temperate and alpine forms are exactly such
  as would be best able to establish themselves in a country already
  stocked mainly by tropical forms and their modified descendants. This
  hypothesis further fulfils the conditions implied in Sir Joseph Hooker's
  anticipation that&mdash;"these great differences (of the floras) will
  present the least difficulties to whatever theory may explain the whole
  case,"&mdash;for it shows that these differences are directly due to the
  history and development of the Australian flora itself, while the
  resemblances depend upon the most certain cause of all such broad
  resemblances&mdash;close proximity or actual land connection.</p>

  <p>One objection will undoubtedly be made to the above theory,&mdash;that
  it does not explain why some species of the prominent Australian genera
  Acacia, Eucalyptus, Melaleuca, Grevillea, &amp;c., have not reached New
  Zealand in recent times along with the other temperate forms that have
  established themselves. But it is doubtful whether any detailed
  explanation of such a negative fact is possible, while general
  explanations sufficient to cover it are not wanting. Nothing is more
  certain than that numerous plants never run wild and establish themselves
  in countries where they nevertheless grow freely if cultivated; and the
  explanation of this fact given by Mr. Darwin&mdash;that they are
  prevented doing so by the competition of better adapted forms&mdash;is
  held to be sufficient. In this particular case, however, we have some
  very remarkable evidence of the fact of their non-adaptation. The
  intercourse between New Zealand and Europe has been the means of
  introducing a host of common European plants,&mdash;more than 150 in
  number, as enumerated at the end of the second volume of the
  <i>Handbook</i>; yet, although the intercourse with Australia has
  probably been greater, only two or three Australian plants have similarly
  established themselves. More remarkable still, Sir Joseph Hooker states:
  <!-- Page 508 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page508"></a>{508}</span>"I am informed that the late Mr. Bidwell
  habitually scattered Australian seeds during his extensive travels in New
  Zealand." We may be pretty sure that seeds of such excessively common and
  characteristic groups as <i>Acacia</i> and <i>Eucalyptus</i> would be
  among those so scattered, yet we have no record of any plants of these or
  other peculiar Australian genera ever having been found wild, still less
  of their having spread and taken possession of the soil in the way that
  many European plants have done. We are, then, entitled to conclude that
  the plants above referred to have not established themselves in New
  Zealand (although their seeds may have reached it) because they could not
  successfully compete with the indigenous flora which was already well
  established and better adapted to the conditions of climate and of the
  organic environment. This explanation is so perfectly in accordance with
  a large body of well-known facts, including that which is known to every
  one&mdash;how few of our oldest and hardiest garden plants ever run
  wild&mdash;that the objection above stated will, I feel convinced, have
  no real weight with any naturalists who have paid attention to this class
  of questions.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We have now to deal with another portion of the New Zealand flora
  which presents perhaps equal difficulties&mdash;that which appears to
  have been derived from remote parts of the north and south temperate
  zones; and this will lead us to inquire into the origin of the northern
  or Arctic element in all the south temperate floras.</p>

  <p>More than one-third of the entire number of New Zealand genera (115)
  are found also in Europe, and even fifty-eight species are identical in
  these remote parts of the world. Temperate South America has seventy-four
  genera in common with New Zealand, and there are even eleven species
  identical in the two countries, as well as thirty-two which are close
  allies or representative species. <!-- Page 510 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page510"></a>{510}</span>A considerable number
  of these northern or Antarctic plants and many more which are
  representative species, are found also in Tasmania and in the mountains
  of temperate Australia; and Sir Joseph Hooker gives a list of
  thirty-eight species very characteristic of Europe and Northern Asia, but
  almost or quite unknown in the warmer regions, which yet reappear in
  temperate Australia. Other genera seem altogether Antarctic&mdash;that
  is, confined to the extreme southern lands and islands; and these often
  have representative species in Southern America, Tasmania, and New
  Zealand, while others occur only in one or two of these areas. Many north
  temperate genera also occur in the mountains of South Africa. On the
  other hand, few if any of the peculiar Australian or Antarctic types have
  spread northwards, except some of the former which have reached the
  mountains of Borneo, and a few of the latter which spread along the Andes
  to Mexico.</p>

  <p>On these remarkable facts, of which I have given but the barest
  outline, Sir Joseph Hooker makes the following suggestive
  observations:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"When I take a comprehensive view of the vegetation of the Old World,
  I am struck with the appearance it presents of there being a continuous
  current of vegetation (if I may so fancifully express myself) from
  Scandinavia to Tasmania; along, in short, the whole extent of that arc of
  the terrestrial sphere which presents the greatest continuity of land. In
  the first place Scandinavian genera, and even species, reappear
  everywhere from Lapland and Iceland to the tops of the Tasmanian Alps, in
  rapidly diminishing numbers it is true, but in vigorous development
  throughout. They abound on the Alps and Pyrenees, pass on to the Caucasus
  and Himalayas, thence they extend along the Khasia Mountains, and those
  of the peninsulas of India to those of Ceylon and the Malayan Archipelago
  (Java and Borneo), and after a hiatus of 30° they appear on the Alps of
  New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, and beyond these again on those
  of New Zealand and the Antarctic Islands, many of the species remaining
  unchanged throughout! It matters not what the vegetation of the bases and
  flanks of these mountains may be; the northern species may be <!-- Page
  511 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page511"></a>{511}</span>associated
  with alpine forms of Germanic, Siberian, Oriental, Chinese, American,
  Malayan, and finally Australian, and Antarctic types; but whereas these
  are all, more or less, local assemblages, the Scandinavian asserts his
  prerogative of ubiquity from Britain to beyond its antipodes."<a
  name="NtA_189" href="#Nt_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is impossible to place the main facts more forcibly before the
  reader than in the above striking passage. It shows clearly that this
  portion of the New Zealand flora is due to wide-spread causes which have
  acted with even greater effect in other south temperate lands, and that
  in order to explain its origin we must grapple with the entire problem of
  the transfer of the north temperate flora to the southern hemisphere.
  Taking, therefore, the facts as given by Sir Joseph Hooker in the works
  already referred to, I shall discuss the whole question broadly, and
  shall endeavour to point out the general laws and subordinate causes
  that, in my opinion, have been at work in bringing about the anomalous
  phenomena of distribution he has done so much to make known and to
  elucidate.</p>

  <p><i>Aggressive Power of the Scandinavian Flora.</i>&mdash;The first
  important fact bearing upon this question is the wonderful aggressive and
  colonising power of the Scandinavian flora, as shown by the way in which
  it establishes itself in any temperate country to which it may gain
  access. About 150 species have thus established themselves in New
  Zealand, often taking possession of large tracts of country; about the
  same number are found in Australia, and nearly as many in the Atlantic
  states of America, where they form the commonest weeds. Whether or not we
  accept Mr. Darwin's explanation of this power as due to development in
  the most extensive land area of the globe where competition has been most
  severe and long-continued, the fact of the existence of this power
  remains, and we can see how important an agent it must be in the
  formation of the floras of any lands to which these aggressive plants
  have been able to gain access.</p>

  <p>But not only are these plants pre-eminently capable of holding their
  own in any temperate country in the world, but they also have exceptional
  powers of migration and <!-- Page 512 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page512"></a>{512}</span>dispersal over seas and oceans. This is
  especially well shown by the case of the Azores, where no less than 400
  out of a total of 478 flowering plants are identical with European
  species. These islands are more than 800 miles from Europe, and, as we
  have already seen in Chapter XII., there is no reason for supposing that
  they have ever been more nearly connected with it than they are now,
  since an extension of the European coast to the 1,000-fathom line would
  very little reduce the distance. Now it is a most interesting and
  suggestive fact that more than half the European genera which occur in
  the Australian flora occur also in the Azores, and in several cases even
  the species are identical in both.<a name="NtA_190"
  href="#Nt_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> The importance of such a case as this
  cannot be exaggerated, because it affords a demonstration of the power of
  the very plants in question to pass over wide areas of sea, some no doubt
  wholly through the air, carried by storms in the same way as the European
  birds and insects which annually reach the Azores, others by floating on
  the waters, or by a combination of the two methods; while some may have
  been carried by aquatic birds, to whose feathers many seeds have the
  power of attaching themselves, and some even in the stomachs of fruit or
  seed eating birds. We have in such facts as these a complete disproof of
  the necessity for those great changes of sea and land which are
  continually appealed to by those who think land-connection the only
  efficient means of accounting for the migration of animals or plants; but
  at the same time we do not neglect to make the fullest use of such
  moderate changes as all the evidence at our command leads us to believe
  have actually occurred, and especially of the former existence of
  intermediate islands, so often indicated by shoals in the midst of the
  deepest oceans.</p>

  <p><i>Means by which Plants have migrated from North to
  South.</i>&mdash;But if plants can thus pass in considerable numbers and
  variety over wide seas and oceans, it must be yet more easy for them to
  traverse continuous areas of land, whereever mountain-chains offer
  suitable stations at moderate <!-- Page 513 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page513"></a>{513}</span>intervals on which they might temporarily
  establish themselves. The facilities afforded for the transmission of
  plants by mountains has hardly received sufficient attention. The
  numerous land-slips, the fresh surfaces of broken rock and precipice, the
  <i>debris</i> of torrents, and the moraines deposited by glaciers, afford
  numerous unoccupied stations on which wind-borne seeds have a good chance
  of germinating. It is a well-known fact that fresh surfaces of soil or
  rock, such as are presented by railway cuttings and embankments, often
  produce plants strange to the locality, which survive for a few years,
  and then disappear as the normal vegetation gains strength and
  permanence.<a name="NtA_191" href="#Nt_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a> But such
  a surface <!-- Page 514 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page514"></a>{514}</span>will, in the meantime, have acted as a
  fresh centre of dispersal; and thus a plant might pass on step by step,
  by means of stations temporarily occupied, till it reached a district
  <!-- Page 515 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page515"></a>{515}</span>where, the general conditions being more
  favourable, it was able to establish itself as a permanent member of the
  flora. Such, generally speaking, was probably the process by which the
  Scandinavian flora has made its way to the southern hemisphere; but it
  could hardly have done so to any important extent without the aid of
  those powerful causes explained in our eighth chapter&mdash;causes which
  acted as a constantly recurrent motive-power to produce that "continuous
  current of vegetation" from north to south across the whole width of the
  tropics referred to by Sir Joseph Hooker. Those causes were, the repeated
  changes <!-- Page 516 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page516"></a>{516}</span>of climate which, during all geological
  time, appear to have occurred in both hemispheres, culminating at rare
  intervals in glacial epochs, and which have been shown to depend upon
  changes of excentricity of the earth's orbit and the occurrence of summer
  or winter in <i>aphelion</i>, in conjunction with the slower and more
  irregular changes of geographical conditions; these combined causes
  acting chiefly through the agency of heat-bearing oceanic currents, and
  of snow- and ice-collecting highlands. Let us now briefly consider how
  such changes would act in favouring the dispersal of plants.</p>

  <p><i>Elevation and Depression of the Snow Line as Aiding the Migration
  of Plants.</i>&mdash;We have endeavoured to show (in an earlier portion
  of this volume) that wherever geographical or physical conditions were
  such as to produce any considerable amount of perpetual snow, this would
  be increased whenever a high degree of excentricity concurred with winter
  in <i>aphelion</i>, and diminished during the opposite phase. On all
  mountain ranges, therefore, which reached above the snow-line, there
  would be a periodical increase and decrease of snow, and when there were
  extensive areas of plateau at about the same level, the lowering of the
  snow-line might cause such an increased accumulation of snow as to
  produce great glaciers and ice-fields, such as we have seen occurred in
  South Africa during the last period of high excentricity. But along with
  such depression of the line of perpetual snow there would be a
  corresponding depression of the alpine and sub-alpine zones suitable for
  the growth of an arctic and temperate vegetation, and, what is perhaps
  more important, the depression would necessarily produce a great
  <i>extension</i> of the area of these zones on all high mountains,
  because as we descend the average slopes become less abrupt,&mdash;thus
  affording a number of new stations suitable for such temperate plants as
  might first reach them. But just above and below the snow-line is the
  area of most powerful disintegration and denudation, from the alternate
  action of frost and sun, of ice and water; and thus the more extended
  area would be subject to the constant occurrence of land-slips,
  berg-falls, and floods, with their <!-- Page 517 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page517"></a>{517}</span>accompanying
  accumulations of <i>débris</i> and of alluvial soil, affording
  innumerable stations in which solitary wind-borne seeds might germinate
  and temporarily establish themselves.</p>

  <p>This lowering and rising of the snow-line each 10,500 years during
  periods of high excentricity, would occur in the northern and southern
  hemispheres alternately; and where there were high mountains within the
  tropics the two would probably overlap each other, so that the northern
  depression would make itself felt in a slight degree even across the
  equator some way into the southern hemisphere, and <i>vice versâ</i>; and
  even if the difference of the height of perpetual snow at the two
  extremes did not average more than a few hundred feet, this would be
  amply sufficient to supply the new and unoccupied stations needful to
  facilitate the migration of plants. It is well known that all great
  mountain ranges have undergone such fluctuations, as proved by ice-marks
  below the present level of snow and ice.</p>

  <p>But the differences of temperature in the two hemispheres caused by
  the sun being in <i>perihelion</i> in the winter of the one while it was
  in <i>aphelion</i> during the same season in the other, would necessarily
  lead to increased aërial and marine currents, as already explained; and
  whenever geographical conditions were such as to favour the production of
  glaciation in any area these effects would become more powerful, and
  would further aid in the dispersal of the seeds of plants.</p>

  <p><i>Changes of Climate Favourable to Migration.</i>&mdash;It is clear
  then, that during periods when no glacial epochs were produced in the
  northern hemisphere, and even when a mild climate extended over the whole
  polar area, alternate changes of climate favouring the dispersal of
  plants would occur on all high mountains, and with particular force on
  such as rise above the snow-line. But during that long-continued, though
  comparatively recent, phase of high excentricity which produced an
  extensive glaciation in the northern hemisphere and local glaciations in
  the southern, these risings and lowerings of the snow-line on all
  mountain ranges would have been at a maximum, and <!-- Page 518 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page518"></a>{518}</span>would have been
  increased by the depression of the ocean which must have arisen from such
  a vast bulk of water being locked up in land-ice, and which depression
  would have produced the same effect as a general elevation of all the
  continents. At this time, too, aërial currents would have attained their
  maximum of force in both hemispheres; and this would greatly facilitate
  the dispersal of all wind-borne seeds as well as of those carried in the
  plumage or in the stomachs of birds, since we have seen, by the cases of
  the Azores and Bermuda, how vastly the migratory powers of birds are
  increased by a stormy atmosphere.</p>

  <p><i>Migration from North to South has been long going
  on.</i>&mdash;Now, if each phase of colder and warmer
  mountain-climate&mdash;each alternate depression and elevation of the
  snow-line, only helped on the migration of a few species some stages of
  the long route from the north to the south temperate regions, yet, during
  the long course of the Tertiary period there might well have arisen that
  representation of the northern flora in the southern hemisphere which is
  now so conspicuous. For it is very important to remark that it is not the
  existing flora alone that is represented, such as might have been
  conveyed during the last glacial epoch only; but we find a whole series
  of northern types evidently of varying degrees of antiquity, while even
  some genera characteristic of the southern hemisphere appear to have been
  originally derived from Europe. Thus Eucalyptus and Metrosideros have
  been determined by Dr. Ettingshausen from their fruits in the Eocene beds
  of Sheppey, while Pimelea, Leptomeria and four genera of Proteaceæ have
  been recognised by Professor Heer in the Miocene of Switzerland; and the
  former writer has detected fifty-five Australian forms in the Eocene
  plant beds of Häring (? Belgium).<a name="NtA_192"
  href="#Nt_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> Then we have such peculiar genera
  <!-- Page 519 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page519"></a>{519}</span>as Pachychladon and Notothlaspi of New
  Zealand said to have affinities with Arctic plants, while
  Stilbocarpa&mdash;another peculiar New Zealand genus&mdash;has its
  nearest allies in the Himalayan and Chinese Aralias. Following these are
  a whole host of very distinct species of northern genera which may date
  back to any part of the Tertiary period, and which occur in every south
  temperate land. Then we have closely allied representative species of
  European or Arctic plants; and, lastly, a number of identical
  species,&mdash;and these two classes are probably due entirely to the
  action of the last great glacial epoch, whose long continuance, and the
  repeated fluctuations of climate with which it commenced and terminated,
  rendered it an agent of sufficient power to have brought about this
  result.</p>

  <p>Here, then, we have that constant or constantly recurrent process of
  dispersal acting throughout long periods with varying power&mdash;that
  "continuous current of vegetation" as it has been termed, which the facts
  demand; and the extraordinary phenomenon of the species and genera of
  European and even of Arctic plants being represented abundantly in South
  America, Australia, and New Zealand, thus adds another to the long series
  of phenomena which are rendered intelligible by frequent alternations of
  warmer and colder climates in either hemisphere, culminating, at long
  intervals and in favourable situations, in actual glacial epochs.</p>

  <p><i>Geological Changes as Aiding Migration.</i>&mdash;It will be well
  also to notice here, that there is another aid to dispersion dependent
  upon the changes effected by denudation during the long periods included
  in the duration of the species and genera of plants. A considerable
  number of <!-- Page 520 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page520"></a>{520}</span>the plants of the Miocene period of Europe
  were so much like existing species that although they have generally
  received fresh names they may well have been identical; and a large
  proportion of the vegetation during the whole Tertiary period consisted
  of genera which are still living.<a name="NtA_193"
  href="#Nt_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a> But from what is now known of the
  rate of sub-aërial denudation, we are sure, that during each division of
  this period many mountain chains must have been considerably lowered,
  while we know that some of the existing ranges have been greatly
  elevated. Ancient volcanoes, too, have been destroyed by denudation, and
  new ones have been built up, so that we may be quite sure that ample
  means for the transmission of temperate plants across the tropics, may
  have existed in countries where they are now no longer to be found. The
  great mountain masses of Guiana and Brazil, for example, must have been
  far more lofty before the sedimentary covering was denuded from their
  granitic bosses and metamorphic peaks, and may have aided the southern
  migration of plants before the final elevation of the Andes. And if
  Africa presents us with an example of a continent of vast antiquity, we
  may be sure that its great central plateaux once bore far loftier
  mountain ranges before they were reduced to their present condition by
  long ages of denudation.</p>

  <p><i>Proofs of Migration by Way of the Andes.</i>&mdash;We are now
  prepared to apply the principles above laid down to the explanation of
  the character and affinities of the various portions of the north
  temperate flora in the southern hemisphere, and especially in Australia
  and New Zealand.</p>

  <p>At the present time the only unbroken chain of highlands and mountains
  connecting the Arctic and north temperate with the Antarctic lands is to
  be found in the American continent, the only break of importance being
  the comparatively low Isthmus of Panama, where there is <!-- Page 521
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page521"></a>{521}</span>a distance of
  about 300 miles occupied by rugged forest-clad hills, between the lofty
  peaks of Veragua and the northern extremity of the Andes of New Grenada.
  Such distances are, as we have already seen, no barrier to the diffusion
  of plants; and we should accordingly expect that this great continuous
  mountain-chain has formed the most effective agent in aiding the
  southward migration of the Arctic and north temperate vegetation. We do
  find, in fact, not only that a large number of northern genera and many
  species are scattered all along this line of route, but that at the end
  of the long journey, in Southern Chile and Fuegia, they have established
  themselves in such numbers as to form an important part of the flora of
  those countries. From the lists given in the works already referred to,
  it appears that there are between sixty and seventy northern genera in
  Fuegia and Southern Chile, while about forty of the species are
  absolutely identical with those of Europe and the Arctic regions.
  Considering how comparatively little the mountains of South Temperate
  America are yet known, this is a very remarkable result, and it proves
  that the transmission of species must have gone on up to comparatively
  recent times. Yet, as only a few of these species are now found along the
  line of migration, we see that they only occupied such stations
  temporarily; and we may connect their disappearance with the passing away
  of the last glacial period which, by raising the snow-line, reduced the
  area on which alone they could exist, and exposed them to the competition
  of indigenous plants from the belt of country immediately below them.</p>

  <p>Now, just as these numerous species and genera have undoubtedly passed
  along the great American range of mountains, although only now found at
  its two extremes, so others have doubtless passed on further; and have
  found more suitable stations or less severe competition in the Antarctic
  continent and islands, in New Zealand, in Tasmania, and even in Australia
  itself. The route by which they may have reached these countries is
  easily marked out. Immediately south of Cape Horn, at a distance of only
  500 miles, are the South Shetland Islands and Graham's Land, whence the
  Antarctic continent or a <!-- Page 522 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page522"></a>{522}</span>group of large islands probably extends
  across or around the south polar area to Victoria Land and thence to
  Adélie Land. The outlying Young Island, 12,000 feet high, is about 750
  miles south of the Macquarie Islands, which may be considered a southern
  outlier of the New Zealand group; and the Macquarie Islands are about the
  same distance from the 1,000-fathom line at a point marking the probable
  southern extension of Tasmania. Other islands may have existed at
  intermediate points; but, even as it is, these distances are not greater
  than we know are traversed by plants both by flotation and by aërial
  currents, especially in such a stormy atmosphere as that of the Antarctic
  regions. Now, we may further assume, that what we know occurred within
  the Arctic circle also took place in the Antarctic&mdash;that is, that
  there have been alternations of climate during which some portion of what
  are now ice-clad lands became able to support a considerable amount of
  vegetation.<a name="NtA_194" href="#Nt_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> During
  such periods there would be a steady migration of plants from all
  southern circumpolar countries to people the comparatively unoccupied
  continent, and the southern extremity of America being considerably the
  nearest, and also being the best stocked with those northern types which
  have such great powers of migration and colonisation, such plants would
  form the bulk of the Antarctic vegetation, and during the continuance of
  the milder southern climate would occupy the whole area.</p>

  <p>When the cold returned and the land again became ice-clad, these
  plants would be crowded towards the outer margins of the Antarctic land
  and its islands, and some of them would find their way across the sea to
  such countries as offered on their mountain summits suitable cool
  stations; and as this process of alternately receiving plants from Chile
  and Fuegia and transmitting them in all directions from the central
  Antarctic land may have been <!-- Page 523 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page523"></a>{523}</span>repeated several times during the Tertiary
  period, we have no difficulty in understanding the general community
  between the European and Antarctic plants found in all south temperate
  lands. Kerguelen's Land and The Crozets are within about the same
  distance from the Antarctic continent as New Zealand and Tasmania, and we
  need not therefore be surprised at finding in each of these islands some
  Fuegian species which have not reached the others. Of course, there will
  remain difficulties of detail, as there always must remain, so long as
  our knowledge of the past changes of the earth's surface and the history
  of the particular plants concerned is so imperfect. Sir Joseph Hooker
  notes, for example, the curious fact that several Compositæ common to
  three such remote localities as the Auckland Islands, Fuegia, and
  Kerguelen's Land, have no pappus or seed-down, while such as have pappus
  are in no case common even to two of these islands. Without knowing the
  exact history and distribution of the genera to which these plants belong
  it would be useless to offer any conjecture, except that they are ancient
  forms which may have survived great geographical changes, or may have
  some peculiar and exceptional means of dispersion.</p>

  <p><i>Proofs of Migration by way of the Himalayas and Southern
  Asia.</i>&mdash;But although we may thus explain the presence of a
  considerable portion of the European element in the floras of New Zealand
  and Australia, we cannot account for the whole of it by this means,
  because Australia itself contains a host of European and Asiatic genera
  of which we find no trace in New Zealand or South America, or any other
  Antarctic land. We find, in fact, in Australia two distinct sets of
  European plants. First we have a number of species identical with those
  of Northern Europe or Asia (of the most characteristic of
  which&mdash;thirty-eight in number&mdash;Sir Joseph Hooker gives a list);
  and in the second place a series of European genera usually of a somewhat
  more southern character, mostly represented by very distinct species, and
  all absent from New Zealand; such as Clematis, Papaver, Cleome, Polygala,
  Lavatera, Ajuga, &amp;c. Now of the first set&mdash;the North European
  <i>species</i>&mdash;about three-fourths occur in some parts of America,
  <!-- Page 524 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page524"></a>{524}</span>and about half in South Temperate America
  or New Zealand; whence we may conclude that most of these, as well as
  some others, have reached Australia by the route already indicated. The
  second set of Australo-European genera, however, and many others
  characteristic of the South European or the Himalayan flora, have
  probably reached Australia by way of the mountains of Southern Asia,
  Borneo, the Moluccas, and New Guinea, at a somewhat remote period when
  loftier ranges and some intermediate peaks may have existed, sufficient
  to carry on the migration by the aid of the alternate climatal changes
  which are known to have occurred. The long belt of Secondary and
  Palæozoic formations in East Australia from Tasmania to Cape York
  continued by the lofty ranges of New Guinea, indicates the route of this
  immigration, and sufficiently explains how it is that these northern
  types are almost wholly confined to this part of the Australian
  continent. Some of the earlier immigrants of this class no doubt passed
  over to New Zealand and now form a portion of the peculiar genera
  confined to these two countries; but most of them are of later date, and
  have thus remained in Australia only.</p>

  <p><i>Proofs of Migration by way of the African Highlands.</i>&mdash;It
  is owing to this twofold current of vegetation flowing into Australia by
  widely different routes that we have in this distant land a better
  representation of the European flora, both as regards species and genera,
  than in any other part of the southern hemisphere; and, so far as I can
  judge of the facts, there is no general phenomenon&mdash;that is, nothing
  in the distribution of genera and other groups of plants as opposed to
  cases of individual species&mdash;that is not fairly accounted for by
  such an origin. It further receives support from the case of South
  Africa, which also contains a large and important representation of the
  northern flora. But here we see no indications (or very slight ones) of
  that southern influx which has given Australia such a community of
  vegetation with the Antarctic lands. There are no less than sixty
  <i>genera</i> of strictly north temperate plants in South Africa, none of
  which occur in Australia; while very few of the <i>species</i>, so
  characteristic of Australia, New Zealand, and Fuegia, are found there. It
  <!-- Page 525 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page525"></a>{525}</span>is clear, therefore, that South Africa has
  received its European plants by the direct route through the Abyssinian
  highlands and the lofty equatorial mountains, and mostly at a distant
  period when the conditions for migration were somewhat more favourable
  than they are now. The much greater directness of the route from Northern
  Europe to South Africa than to Australia; and the existence even now of
  lofty mountains and extensive highlands for a large portion of the
  distance, will explain (what Sir Joseph Hooker notes as "a very curious
  fact") why South Africa has more very northern European <i>genera</i>
  than Australia, while Australia has more identical <i>species</i> and a
  better representation on the whole of the European flora&mdash;this being
  clearly due to the large influx of species it has received from the
  Antarctic Islands, in addition to those which have entered it by way of
  Asia. The greater distance of South Africa even now from any of these
  islands, and the much deeper sea to the south of the African continent,
  than in the case of Tasmania and New Zealand, indicating a smaller recent
  extension southward, is all quite in harmony with the facts of
  distribution of the northern flora above referred to.</p>

  <p><i>Supposed Connection of South Africa and Australia.</i>&mdash;There
  remains, however, the small amount of direct affinity between the
  vegetation of South Africa and that of Australia, New Zealand, and
  Temperate South America, consisting in all of fifteen genera, five of
  which are confined to Australia and South Africa, while several natural
  orders are better represented in these two countries than in any other
  part of the world. This resemblance has been supposed to imply some
  former land-connection of all the great southern lands, but it appears to
  me that any such supposition is wholly unnecessary. The differences
  between the faunas and floras of these countries are too great and too
  radical to render it possible that any such connection should have
  existed except at a very remote period. But if we have to go back so far
  for an explanation, a much simpler one presents itself, and one more in
  accordance with what we have learnt of the general permanence of deep
  oceans and the great changes that have taken place <!-- Page 526 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page526"></a>{526}</span>in the distribution of
  all forms of life. Just as we explain the presence of marsupials in
  Australia and America and of Centetidæ in Madagascar and the Antilles, by
  the preservation in these localities of remnants of once wide-spread
  types, so we should prefer to consider the few genera common to Australia
  and South Africa as remnants of an ancient vegetation, once spread over
  the northern hemisphere, driven southward by the pressure of more
  specialised types, and now finding a refuge in these two widely separated
  southern lands. It is suggestive of such an explanation that these genera
  are either of very ancient groups&mdash;as Conifers and Cycads&mdash;or
  plants of low organisation as the Restiaceæ&mdash;or of world-wide
  distribution, as Melanthaceæ.</p>

  <p><i>The Endemic Genera of Plants in New Zealand.</i>&mdash;Returning
  now to the New Zealand flora, with which we are more especially
  concerned, there only remains to be considered the peculiar or endemic
  genera which characterise it. These are thirty-two in number, and are
  mostly very isolated. A few have affinities with Arctic groups, others
  with Himalayan, or Australian genera; several are tropical forms, but the
  majority appear to be altogether peculiar types of world-wide
  groups&mdash;as Leguminosæ, Saxifrageæ, Compositæ, Orchideæ, &amp;c. We
  must evidently trace back these peculiar forms to the earliest
  immigrants, either from the north or from the south; and the great
  antiquity we are obliged to give to New Zealand&mdash;an antiquity
  supported by every feature in its fauna and flora, no less than by its
  geological structure, and its extinct forms of life<a name="NtA_195"
  href="#Nt_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a>&mdash;affords ample time for the
  changes in the general distribution of plants, and for those due to
  isolation and modification under <!-- Page 527 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page527"></a>{527}</span>the influence of
  changed conditions, which are manifested by the extreme peculiarity of
  many of these interesting endemic forms.</p>

  <p><i>The Absence of Southern Types from the Northern
  Hemisphere.</i>&mdash;We have now only to notice the singular want of
  reciprocity in the migrations of northern and southern types of
  vegetation. In return for the vast number of European plants which have
  reached Australia, not one single Australian plant has entered any part
  of the north temperate zone, and the same may be said of the typical
  southern vegetation in general, whether developed in the Antarctic lands,
  New Zealand, South America, or South Africa. The furthest northern
  outliers of the southern flora are a few genera of Antarctic type on the
  Bornean Alps; the genus Acæna which has a species in California; two
  representatives of the Australian flora&mdash;Casuarina and Stylidium, in
  the peninsula of India; while China and the Philippines have two strictly
  Australian genera of Orchideæ&mdash;Microtis and Thelymitra, as well as a
  Restiaceous genus. Several distinct causes appear to have combined to
  produce this curious inability of the southern flora to make its way into
  the northern hemisphere. The primary cause is, no doubt, the totally
  different distribution of land in the two hemispheres, so that in the
  south there is the minimum of land in the colder parts of the temperate
  zone and in the north the maximum. This is well shown by the fact that on
  the parallel of Lat. 50° N. we pass over 240° of land or shallow sea,
  while on the same parallel of south latitude we have only 4°, where we
  cross the southern part of Patagonia. Again the three most important
  south temperate land-areas&mdash;South Temperate America, South Africa,
  and Australia&mdash;are widely separated from each other, and have in all
  probability always been so; whereas the whole of the north temperate
  lands are practically continuous. It follows that, instead of the
  enormous northern area, in which highly organised and dominant groups of
  plants have been developed gifted with great colonising and aggressive
  powers, we have in the south three comparatively small and detached
  areas, in which rich floras have been developed with <i>special</i> <!--
  Page 528 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page528"></a>{528}</span>adaptations to soil, climate, and organic
  environment, but comparatively impotent and inferior beyond their own
  domain.</p>

  <p>Another circumstance which makes the contest between the northern and
  southern forms still more unequal, is the much greater hardiness of the
  former, from having been developed in a colder region, and one where
  alpine and arctic conditions extensively prevail; whereas the southern
  floras have been mainly developed in mild regions to which they have been
  altogether confined. While the northern plants have been driven north or
  south by each succeeding change of climate, the southern species have
  undergone comparatively slight changes of this nature, owing to the areas
  they occupy being unconnected with the ice-bearing Antarctic continent.
  It follows, that whereas the northern plants find in all these southern
  lands a milder and more equable climate than that to which they have been
  accustomed, and are thus often able to grow and flourish even more
  vigorously than in their native land, the southern plants would find in
  almost every part of Europe, North America or Northern Asia, a more
  severe and less equable climate, with winters that usually prove fatal to
  them even under cultivation. These causes, taken separately, are very
  powerful, but when combined they must, I think, be held to be amply
  sufficient to explain why examples of the typical southern vegetation are
  almost unknown in the north temperate zone, while a very few of them have
  extended so far as the northern tropic.<a name="NtA_196"
  href="#Nt_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 529 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page529"></a>{529}</span></p>

  <p><i>Concluding Remarks on the Last Two Chapters.</i>&mdash;Our inquiry
  into the external relations and probable origin of the fauna and flora of
  New Zealand, has thus led us on to a general theory as to the cause of
  the peculiar biological relations between the northern and the southern
  hemispheres; and no better or more typical example could be found of the
  wide range and great interest of the study of the geographical
  distribution of animals and plants.</p>

  <p>The solution which has here been given of one of the most difficult of
  this class of problems, has been rendered possible solely by the
  knowledge very recently obtained of the form of the sea-bottom in the
  southern ocean, and of the geological structure of the great Australian
  continent. Without this knowledge we should have nothing but a series of
  guesses or probabilities on which to found our hypothetical explanation,
  which we have now been able to build up on a solid foundation of fact.
  The complete separation of East from West Australia during a portion of
  the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods, could never have been guessed till
  it was established by the laborious explorations of the Australian
  geologists; while the hypothesis of a comparatively shallow sea, uniting
  New Zealand by a long route with tropical Australia, while a profoundly
  deep ocean always separated it from temperate Australia, would have been
  rejected as too improbable a supposition for the foundation of even the
  most enticing theory. Yet it is mainly by means of these two facts, that
  we are enabled to give an adequate explanation of the strange anomalies
  in the flora of Australia and its relation to that of New Zealand.</p>

  <p>In the more general explanation of the relations of the various
  northern and southern floras, I have shown what an important aid to any
  such explanation is the theory of repeated changes of climate, not
  necessarily of great amount, given in Chapters VIII. and IX.; while the
  whole discussion justifies the importance attached to the theory of the
  general permanence of continents and oceans, as demonstrated in Chapter
  VI., since any rational explanation based upon facts (as opposed to mere
  unsupported <!-- Page 530 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page530"></a>{530}</span>conjecture) must take such general
  permanence as a starting-point. The whole inquiry into the phenomena
  presented by islands, which forms the main subject of the present volume
  has, I think, shown that this theory does afford a firm foundation for
  the discussion of questions of distribution and dispersal; and that by
  its aid, combined with a clear perception of the wonderful powers of
  dispersion and modification in the organic world when long periods are
  considered, the most difficult problems connected with this subject cease
  to be insoluble.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The present volume has gone over a very wide field both of facts and
  theories, and it will be well to recall these to the reader's attention
  and point out their connection with each other, in a concluding chapter.
  I hope to be able to show that, although at first sight somewhat
  fragmentary and disconnected, this work is really the development of a
  clear and definite theory, and its application to the solution of a
  number of biological problems. That theory is, briefly, that the
  distribution of the various species and groups of living things over the
  earth's surface, and their aggregation in definite assemblages in certain
  areas, is the <!-- Page 532 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page532"></a>{532}</span>direct result and outcome of a complex set
  of causes, which may be grouped as "biological" and "physical." The
  biological causes are mainly of two kinds&mdash;firstly, the constant
  tendency of all organisms to increase in numbers and to occupy a wider
  area, and their various powers of dispersion and migration through which,
  when unchecked, they are enabled to spread widely over the globe; and,
  secondly, those laws of evolution and extinction which determine the
  manner in which groups of organisms arise and grow, reach their maximum,
  and then dwindle away, often breaking up into separate portions which
  long survive in very remote regions. The physical causes are also mainly
  of two kinds. We have, first, the geographical changes which at one time
  isolate a whole fauna and flora, at another time lead to their dispersal
  and intermixture with adjacent faunas and floras&mdash;and it was here
  important to ascertain and define the exact nature and extent of these
  changes, and to determine the question of the general stability or
  instability of continents and oceans; in the second place, it was
  necessary to determine the exact nature, extent and frequency of the
  changes of climate which have occurred in various parts of the
  earth,&mdash;because such changes are among the most powerful agents in
  causing the dispersal and extinction of plants and animals. Hence the
  importance attached to the question of geological climates and their
  causes, which have been here investigated at some length with the aid of
  the most recent researches of geologists, physicists, and explorers.
  These various inquiries led on to an investigation of the mode of
  formation of stratified deposits, with a view to fix within some limits
  their probable age; and also to an estimate of the probable rate of
  development of the organic world; and both these processes are shown to
  involve, so far as we can judge, periods of time less vast than have
  generally been thought necessary.</p>

  <p>The numerous facts and theories established in the First Part of the
  work are then applied to explain the phenomena presented by the floras
  and faunas of the chief islands of the globe, which are classified, in
  accordance with their physical origin, in three groups or classes, each
  <!-- Page 533 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page533"></a>{533}</span>of which are shown to exhibit certain
  well-marked biological features.</p>

  <p>Having thus shown that the work is a connected whole, founded on the
  principle of tracing out the more recondite causes of the distribution of
  organisms, we will briefly indicate the scope and object of the several
  chapters, by means of which this general conception has been carried
  out.</p>

  <p>Beginning with simple and familiar facts relating to British and
  European quadrupeds and birds, I have defined and shown the exact
  character of "areas of distribution," as applied to species, genera, and
  families, and have illustrated the subject by maps showing the
  peculiarities of distribution of some well-known groups of birds. Taking
  then our British mammals and land-birds, I follow them over the whole
  area they inhabit, and thus obtain a foundation for the establishment of
  "zoological regions," and a clear insight into their character as
  distinct from the usual geographical divisions of the globe.</p>

  <p>The facts thus far established are then shown to be necessary results
  of the "law of evolution." The nature and amount of "variation" is
  exhibited by a number of curious examples; the origin, growth, and decay
  of species and genera are traced, and all the interesting phenomena of
  isolated groups and discontinuous generic and specific areas are shown to
  follow as logical consequences.</p>

  <p>The next subject investigated is the means by which the various groups
  of animals are enabled to overcome the natural barriers which often seem
  to limit them to very restricted areas, how far those barriers are
  themselves liable to be altered or abolished, and what is the exact
  nature and amount of the changes of sea and land which our earth has
  undergone in past times. This latter part of the inquiry is shown to be
  the most important as it is the most fundamental; and as it is still a
  subject of controversy, and many erroneous views prevail in regard to it,
  it is discussed at some length. Several distinct classes of evidence are
  adduced to prove that the grand features of our globe&mdash;the position
  of the great oceans <!-- Page 534 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page534"></a>{534}</span>and the chief land-areas&mdash;have
  remained, on the whole, unchanged throughout geological time. Our
  continents are shown to be built up mainly of "shore-deposits"; and even
  the chalk, which is so often said to be the exact equivalent of the
  "globigerina ooze" now forming in mid-Atlantic, is shown to be a
  comparatively shallow-water deposit formed in inland seas, or in the
  immediate vicinity of land. The general stability of continents has,
  however, been accompanied by constant changes of form, and insular
  conditions have prevailed over every part in succession; and the effect
  of such changes on the distribution of organisms is pointed out.</p>

  <p>We then approach the consideration of another set of
  changes&mdash;those of climate&mdash;which have probably been agents of
  the first importance in modifying the specific forms as well as the
  distribution of animals. Here again we find ourselves in the midst of
  fierce controversies. The occurrence of a recent glacial epoch of great
  severity in the northern hemisphere is now universally admitted, but the
  causes which brought it on are matter of dispute. But unless we can
  arrive at these causes, as well as at those which produced the equally
  well demonstrated mild climate in the Arctic regions, we shall be quite
  unable to determine the nature and amount of the changes of climate which
  have occurred throughout past ages, and shall thus be left without a most
  important clue to the explanation of many of the anomalies in the
  distribution of animals and plants.</p>

  <p>I have therefore devoted three chapters to a full investigation of
  this question. I have first given such a sketch of the most salient facts
  as to render the phenomena of the glacial epoch clear and intelligible. I
  then review the various suggested explanations, and, taking up the two
  which alone seem tenable, I endeavour to determine the true principles of
  each. While adopting generally Mr. Croll's views as to the causes of the
  "glacial epoch," I have introduced certain limitations and modifications.
  I have pointed out, I believe, more clearly than has hitherto been done,
  the very different effects on climate of water in the liquid and in the
  solid state; and I have <!-- Page 535 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page535"></a>{535}</span>shown, by a variety of evidence, that
  without high land there can be no permanent snow and ice. From these
  facts and principles the very important conclusion is reached, that the
  alternate phases of precession&mdash;causing the winter of each
  hemisphere to be in <i>aphelion</i> and <i>perihelion</i> each 10,500
  years&mdash;would produce a complete change of climate only where a
  country was <i>partially</i> snow-clad; while, whenever a large area
  became almost <i>wholly</i> buried in snow and ice&mdash;as was certainly
  the case with Northern Europe and America during the glacial
  epoch&mdash;then the glacial conditions would be continued and perhaps
  even intensified when the sun approached nearest to the earth in winter,
  instead of there being at that time, as Mr. Croll maintains, an almost
  perpetual spring. This important result is supported by reference to the
  existing differences between the climates of the northern and southern
  hemispheres, and by what is known to have occurred during the last
  glacial epoch; and it is shown to be in complete harmony with the
  geological evidence as to interglacial mild periods.</p>

  <p>Discussing next the evidence for glacial epochs in earlier times, it
  is shown that Mr. Croll's views are opposed by a vast body of facts, and
  that the geological evidence leads irresistibly to the conclusion that
  during a large portion of the Secondary and Tertiary periods,
  uninterrupted warm climates prevailed in the north temperate zone, and so
  far ameliorated the climate of the Arctic regions as to admit of the
  growth of a luxuriant vegetation in the highest latitudes yet explored.
  The geographical condition of the northern hemisphere at these periods is
  then investigated, and it is shown to have been probably such as to admit
  the warm tropical waters freely to penetrate the land, and to reach the
  Arctic seas by several channels; and, adopting Mr. Croll's calculations
  as to the enormous quantity of heat that would thus be conveyed
  northwards, it is maintained that the mild Arctic climates are amply
  accounted for. With such favourable geographical conditions, it is shown,
  that changes of excentricity and of the phases of precession would have
  no other effect than to cause greater differences <!-- Page 536 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page536"></a>{536}</span>of temperature between
  summer and winter; but, wherever there was a considerable extent of very
  lofty mountains the snow-line would be lowered, and the snow-collecting
  area being thus largely increased a considerable amount of local
  glaciation might result. Thus may be explained the presence of enormous
  ice-borne rocks in Eocene and Miocene times in Central Europe, while at
  the very same period all the surrounding country enjoyed a tropical or
  sub-tropical climate.</p>

  <p>The general conclusion is thus reached, that geographical conditions
  are the essential causes of great changes of climate, and that the
  radically different distribution of land and sea in the northern and
  southern hemispheres has generally led to great diversity of climate in
  the Arctic and Antarctic regions. The form and arrangement of the
  continents is shown to be such as to favour the transfer of warm oceanic
  currents to the north far in excess of those which move towards the
  south, and whenever these currents had free passage <i>through</i> the
  northern land-masses to the polar area, a mild climate must have
  prevailed over the whole northern hemisphere. It is only in very recent
  times that the great northern continents have become so completely
  consolidated as they now are, thus shutting out the warm water from their
  interiors, and rendering possible a wide-spread and intense glacial
  epoch. But this great climatal change was actually brought about by the
  high excentricity which occurred about 200,000 years ago; and it is
  doubtful if a similar glaciation in equally low latitudes could be
  produced by means of any such geographical combinations as actually
  occur, without the concurrence of a high excentricity.</p>

  <p>A survey of the present condition of the earth supports this view, for
  though we have enormous mountain ranges in every latitude, there is no
  glaciated country south of Greenland in N. Lat. 61°. But directly we go
  back a very short period, we find the superficial evidences of glaciation
  to an enormous extent over three-fourths of the globe. In the Alps and
  Pyrenees, in the British Isles and Scandinavia, in Spain and the Atlas,
  in the Caucasus <!-- Page 537 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page537"></a>{537}</span>and the Himalayas, in Eastern North
  America and west of the Rocky Mountains, in the Andes of South Temperate
  America, in South Africa, and in New Zealand, huge moraines and other
  unmistakable ice-marks attest the universal descent of the snow-line for
  several thousand feet below its present level. If we reject the influence
  of high excentricity as the cause of this almost universal glaciation, we
  must postulate a general elevation of <i>all</i> these mountains about
  the same time, geologically speaking&mdash;for the general similarity in
  the state of preservation of the ice-marks and the known activity of
  denudation as a destroying agent, forbid the idea that they belong to
  widely separated epochs. It has, indeed, been suggested, that denudation
  alone has lowered these mountains so much during the post-tertiary epoch,
  that they were previously of sufficient height to account for the
  glaciation of all of them; but this hardly needs refutation, for it is
  clear that denudation could not at the same time have removed some
  thousands of feet of rock from many hundreds of square miles of lofty
  snow-collecting plateaus, and yet have left moraines, and blocks, and
  even glacial striæ, undisturbed and uneffaced on the slopes and in the
  valleys of these same mountains.</p>

  <p>The theory of geological climates set forth in this volume, while
  founded on Mr. Croll's researches, differs from all that have yet been
  made public, in clearly tracing out the comparative influence of
  geographical and astronomical revolutions, showing that, while the former
  have been the chief, if not the exclusive, causes of the long-continued
  mild climates of the Arctic regions, the concurrence of the latter has
  been essential to the production of glacial epochs in the temperate
  zones, as well as of those local glaciations in low latitudes, of which
  there is such an abundance of evidence.</p>

  <p>The next question discussed is that of geological time as bearing on
  the development of the organic world. The periods of time usually
  demanded by geologists have been very great, and it was often assumed
  that there was no occasion to limit them. But the theory of development
  demands far more; for the earliest fossiliferous rocks <!-- Page 538
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page538"></a>{538}</span>prove the
  existence of many and varied forms of life which require unrecorded ages
  for their development&mdash;ages probably far longer than those which
  have elapsed from that period to the present day. The physicists,
  however, deny that any such indefinitely long periods are available. The
  sun is ever losing heat far more rapidly than it can be renewed from any
  known or conceivable source. The earth is a cooling body, and must once
  have been too hot to support life; while the friction of the tides is
  checking the earth's rotation, and this cannot have gone on indefinitely
  without making our day much longer than it is. A limit is therefore
  placed to the age of the habitable earth, and it has been thought that
  the time so allowed is not sufficient for the long processes of
  geological change and organic development. It is therefore important to
  inquire whether these processes are either of them so excessively slow as
  has been supposed, and I devote a chapter to the inquiry.</p>

  <p>Geologists have measured with some accuracy the maximum thickness of
  all the known sedimentary rocks. The rate of denudation has also been
  recently measured by a method which, if not precise, at all events gives
  results of the right order of magnitude and which err on the side of
  being too slow rather than too fast. If, then, the <i>maximum</i>
  thickness of the <i>known</i> sedimentary rocks is taken to represent the
  <i>average</i> thickness of <i>all</i> the sedimentary rocks, and we also
  know the <i>amount</i> of sediment carried to the sea or lakes, and the
  <i>area</i> over which that sediment is spread, we have a means of
  calculating the <i>time</i> required for the building up of all the
  sedimentary rocks of the geological system. I have here inquired how far
  the above suppositions are correct, or on which side they probably err;
  and the conclusion arrived at is, that the time required is very much
  less than has hitherto been supposed.</p>

  <p>Another estimate is afforded by the date of the last glacial epoch if
  coincident with the last period of high excentricity, while the Alpine
  glaciation of the Miocene period is assumed to have been caused by the
  next earlier phase of very high excentricity. Taking these as data, the
  <!-- Page 539 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page539"></a>{539}</span>proportionate change of the species of
  mollusca affords a means of arriving at the whole lapse of time
  represented by the fossiliferous rocks; and these two estimates agree in
  the <i>order</i> of their magnitudes.</p>

  <p>It is then argued that the changes of climate every 10,500 years
  during the numerous periods of high excentricity have acted as a motive
  power in hastening on both geological and biological change. By raising
  and lowering the snow-line in all mountain ranges it has caused increased
  denudation; while the same changes have caused much migration and
  disturbance in the organic world, and have thus tended to the more rapid
  modification of species. The present epoch being a period of very low
  excentricity, the earth is in a phase of <i>exceptional stability</i>
  both physical and organic; and it is from this period of exceptional
  stability that our notions of the very slow rate of change have been
  derived.</p>

  <p>The conclusion is, on the whole, that the periods allowed by
  physicists are not only far in excess of such as are required for
  geological and organic change, but that they allow ample margin for a
  lapse of time anterior to the deposit of the earliest fossiliferous rocks
  several times longer than the time which has elapsed since their deposit
  to the present day.</p>

  <p>Having thus laid the foundation for a scientific interpretation of the
  phenomena of distribution, we proceed to the Second Part of our
  work&mdash;the discussion of a series of typical Insular Faunas and
  Floras with a view to explain the interesting phenomena they present.
  Taking first two North Atlantic groups&mdash;the Azores and
  Bermuda&mdash;it is shown how important an agent in the dispersal of most
  animals and plants is a stormy atmosphere. Although 900 and 700 miles
  respectively from the nearest continents, their productions are very
  largely identical with those of Europe and America; and, what is more
  important, fresh arrivals of birds, insects, and plants, are now taking
  place almost annually. These islands afford, therefore, test examples of
  the great dispersive powers of certain groups of organisms, and thus
  serve as a basis on which to found our explanations of many anomalies of
  distribution. Passing <!-- Page 540 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page540"></a>{540}</span>on to the Galapagos we have a group less
  distant from a continent and of larger area, yet, owing to special
  conditions, of which the comparatively stormless equatorial atmosphere is
  the most important, exhibiting far more speciality in its productions
  than the more distant Azores. Still, however, its fauna and flora are as
  unmistakably derived from the American continent as those of the Azores
  are from the European.</p>

  <p>We next take St. Helena and the Sandwich Islands, both wonderfully
  isolated in the midst of vast oceans, and no longer exhibiting in their
  productions an exclusive affinity to one continent. Here we have to
  recognise the results of immense antiquity, and of those changes of
  geography, of climate, and in the general distribution of organisms which
  we know have occurred in former geological epochs, and whose causes and
  consequences we have discussed in the first part of our volume. This
  concludes our review of the Oceanic Islands.</p>

  <p>Coming now to Continental Islands we consider first those of most
  recent origin and offering the simplest phenomena; and begin with the
  British Isles as affording the best example of very recent and well known
  Continental Islands. Reviewing the interesting past history of Britain,
  we show why it is comparatively poor in species and why this poverty is
  still greater in Ireland. By a careful examination of its fauna and flora
  it is then shown that the British Isles are not so completely identical,
  biologically, with the continent as has been supposed. A considerable
  amount of speciality is shown to exist, and that this speciality is real
  and not apparent is supported by the fact, that small outlying islands,
  such as the Isle of Man, the Shetland Isles, Lundy Island, and the Isle
  of Wight, all possess certain species or varieties not found
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Borneo and Java are next taken, as illustrations of tropical islands
  which may be not more ancient than Britain, but which, owing to their
  much larger area, greater distance from the continent, and the extreme
  richness of the equatorial fauna and flora, possess a large proportion of
  peculiar species, though these are in general very closely allied to
  those of the adjacent parts of Asia. The <!-- Page 541 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page541"></a>{541}</span>preliminary studies we
  have made enable us to afford a simpler and more definite interpretation
  of the peculiar relations of Java to the continent and its differences
  from Borneo and Sumatra, than was given in my former work (<i>The
  Geographical Distribution of Animals</i>).</p>

  <p>Japan and Formosa are next taken, as examples of islands which are
  decidedly somewhat more ancient than those previously considered, and
  which present a number of very interesting phenomena, especially in their
  relations to each other, and to remote rather than to adjacent parts of
  the Asiatic continent.</p>

  <p>We now pass to the group of Ancient Continental Islands, of which
  Madagascar is the most typical example. It is surrounded by a number of
  smaller islands which may be termed its satellites since they partake of
  many of its peculiarities; though some of these&mdash;as the Comoros and
  Seychelles&mdash;may be considered continental, while others&mdash;as
  Bourbon, Mauritius, and Rodriguez&mdash;are decidedly oceanic. In order
  to understand the peculiarities of the Madagascar fauna we have to
  consider the past history of the African and Asiatic continents, which it
  is shown are such as to account for all the main peculiarities of the
  fauna of these islands without having recourse to the hypothesis of a
  now-submerged Lemurian continent. Considerable evidence is further
  adduced to show that "Lemuria" is a myth, since not only is its existence
  unnecessary, but it can be proved that it would not explain the actual
  facts of distribution. The origin of the interesting Mascarene wingless
  birds is discussed, and the main peculiarities of the remarkable flora of
  Madagascar and the Mascarene islands pointed out; while it is shown that
  all these phenomena are to be explained on the general principles of the
  permanence of the great oceans and the comparatively slight fluctuations
  of the land area, and by taking account of established palæontological
  facts.</p>

  <p>There remain two other islands&mdash;Celebes and New
  Zealand&mdash;which are classed as "anomalous," the one because it is
  almost impossible to place it in any of the six zoological regions, or
  determine whether it has ever been actually joined to a
  continent&mdash;the other because it <!-- Page 542 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page542"></a>{542}</span>combines the
  characteristics of continental and oceanic islands.</p>

  <p>The peculiarities of the Celebesian fauna have already been dwelt upon
  in several previous works, but they are so remarkable and so unique that
  they cannot be omitted in a treatise on "Insular Faunas"; and here, as in
  the case of Borneo and Java, fuller consideration and the application of
  the general principles laid down in our First Part, lead to a solution of
  the problem at once more simple and more satisfactory than any which have
  been previously proposed. I now look upon Celebes as an outlying portion
  of the great Asiatic continent of Miocene times, which either by
  submergence or some other cause had lost the greater portion of its
  animal inhabitants, and since then has remained more or less completely
  isolated from every other land. It has thus preserved a fragment of a
  very ancient fauna along with a number of later types which have reached
  it from surrounding islands by the ordinary means of dispersal. This
  sufficiently explains all the peculiar <i>affinities</i> of its animals,
  though the peculiar and distinctive <i>characters</i> of some of them
  remain as mysterious as ever.</p>

  <p>New Zealand is shown to be so completely continental in its geological
  structure, and its numerous wingless birds so clearly imply a former
  connection with some other land (as do its numerous lizards and its
  remarkable reptile, the Hatteria), that the total absence of indigenous
  land-mammalia was hardly to be expected. Some attention is therefore
  given to the curious animal which has been seen but never captured, and
  this is shown to be probably identical with an animal referred to by
  Captain Cook. The more accurate knowledge which has recently been
  obtained of the sea bottom around New Zealand enables us to determine
  that the former connection of that island with Australia was towards the
  north, and this is found to agree well with many of the peculiarities of
  its fauna.</p>

  <p>The flora of New Zealand and that of Australia are now both so well
  known, and they present so many peculiarities, and relations of so
  anomalous a character, <!-- Page 543 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page543"></a>{543}</span>as to present in Sir Joseph Hooker's
  opinion an almost insoluble problem. Much additional information on the
  physical and geological history of these two countries has, however, been
  obtained since the appearance of Sir Joseph Hooker's works, and I
  therefore determined to apply to them the same method of discussion and
  treatment which has been usually successful with similar problems in the
  case of animals. The fact above noted, that New Zealand was connected
  with Australia in its northern and tropical portion only, of itself
  affords a clue to one portion of the specialities of the New Zealand
  flora&mdash;the presence of an unusual number of tropical families and
  genera, while the temperate forms consist mainly of species either
  identical with those found in Australia or closely allied to them. But a
  still more important clue is obtained in the geological structure of
  Australia itself, which is shown to have been for long periods divided
  into an eastern and a western island, in the latter of which the highly
  peculiar flora of temperate Australia was developed. This is found to
  explain with great exactness the remarkable absence from New Zealand of
  all the most abundant and characteristic Australian genera, both of
  plants and of animals, since these existed at that time only in the
  <i>western</i> island, while New Zealand was in connection with the
  <i>eastern</i> island alone and with the tropical portion of it. From
  these geological and physical facts, and the known powers of dispersal of
  plants, all the main features, and many of the detailed peculiarities of
  the New Zealand flora are shown necessarily to result.</p>

  <p>Our last chapter is devoted to a wider, and if possible more
  interesting subject&mdash;the origin of the European element in the
  floras of New Zealand and Australia, and also in those of South America
  and South Africa. This is so especially a botanical question, that it was
  with some diffidence I entered upon it, yet it arose so naturally from
  the study of the New Zealand and Australian floras, and seemed to have so
  much light thrown upon it by our preliminary studies as to changes of
  climate and the causes which have favoured the distribution of plants,
  that I felt my work would be incomplete without a consideration of <!--
  Page 544 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page544"></a>{544}</span>it.
  The subject will be so fresh in the reader's mind that a complete summary
  of it is unnecessary. I venture to think, however, that I have shown, not
  only the several routes by which the northern plants have reached the
  various southern lands, but have pointed out the special aids to their
  migration, and the motive power which has urged them on.</p>

  <p>In this discussion, if nowhere else, will be found a complete
  justification of that lengthy investigation of the exact nature of past
  changes of climate, which to some readers may have seemed unnecessary and
  unsuited to such a work as the present. Without the clear and definite
  conclusions arrived at by that discussion, and those equally important
  views as to the permanence of the great features of the earth's surface,
  and the wonderful dispersive powers of plants which have been so
  frequently brought before us in our studies of insular floras, I should
  not have ventured to attack the wide and difficult problem of the
  northern element in southern floras.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In concluding a work dealing with subjects which have occupied my
  attention for many years, I trust that the reader who has followed me
  throughout will be imbued with the conviction that ever presses upon
  myself, of the complete interdependence of organic and inorganic nature.
  Not only does the marvellous structure of each organised being involve
  the whole past history of the earth, but such apparently unimportant
  facts as the presence of certain types of plants or animals in one island
  rather than in another, are now shown to be dependent on the long series
  of past geological changes&mdash;on those marvellous astronomical
  revolutions which cause a periodic variation of terrestrial
  climates&mdash;on the apparently fortuitous action of storms and currents
  in the conveyance of germs&mdash;and on the endlessly varied actions and
  reactions of organised beings on each other. And although these various
  causes are far too complex in their combined action to enable us to
  follow them out in the case of any one species, yet their broad results
  are clearly recognisable; and we are thus encouraged to study more
  completely every detail and <!-- Page 545 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page545"></a>{545}</span>every anomaly in the distribution of
  living things, in the firm conviction that by so doing we shall obtain a
  fuller and clearer insight into the course of nature, and with increased
  confidence that the "mighty maze" of Being we see everywhere around us is
  "not without a plan."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_1" href="#NtA_1">[1]</a> A small number of species
  belonging to the West Indies are found in the extreme southern portion of
  the Florida Peninsula.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_2" href="#NtA_2">[2]</a> I cannot avoid here referring to
  the enormous waste of labour and money with comparatively scanty and
  unimportant results to natural history of most of the great scientific
  voyages of the various civilized governments during the present century.
  All these expeditions combined have done far less than private collectors
  in making known the products of remote lands and islands. They have
  brought home fragmentary collections, made in widely scattered
  localities, and these have been usually described in huge folios or
  quartos, whose value is often in inverse proportion to their bulk and
  cost. The same species have been collected again and again, often
  described several times over under new names, and not unfrequently stated
  to be from places they never inhabited. The result of this wretched
  system is that the productions of some of the most frequently visited and
  most interesting islands on the globe are still very imperfectly known,
  while their native plants and animals are being yearly exterminated, and
  this is the case even with countries under the rule or protection of
  European governments. Such are the Sandwich Islands, Tahiti, the
  Marquesas, the Philippine Islands, and a host of smaller ones; while
  Bourbon and Mauritius, St. Helena, and several others, have only been
  adequately explored after an important portion of their productions has
  been destroyed by cultivation or the reckless introduction of goats and
  pigs. The employment in each of our possessions, and those of other
  European powers, of a resident naturalist at a very small annual expense,
  would have done more for the advancement of knowledge in this direction
  than all the expensive expeditions that have again and again
  circumnavigated the globe.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_8" href="#NtA_8">[8]</a> Remains of the dingo have been
  found fossil in Pleistocene deposits but the antiquity of man in
  Australia is not known. It is not, however, improbable that it may be as
  great as in Europe. My friend A.&nbsp;C. Swinton, Esq., while working in the
  then almost unknown gold-field of Maryborough, Victoria, in January,
  1855, found a fragment of a well-formed stone axe resting on the
  metamorphic schistose bed-rock about five feet beneath the surface. It
  was overlain by the compact gravel drift called by the miners "cement,"
  and by an included layer of hard iron-stained sandstone. The fragment is
  about an inch and three-eighths wide and the same length, and is of very
  hard fine-grained black basalt. One side is ground to a very smooth and
  regular surface, terminating in a well-formed cutting edge more than an
  inch long, the return face of the cutting part being about a quarter of
  an inch wide. The other side is a broken surface. The weapon appears to
  have been an axe or tomahawk closely resembling that figured at p. 335 of
  Lumholtz's <i>Among Cannibals</i>, from Central Queensland. The fragment
  was discovered by Mr. Swinton and the late Mr. Mackworth Shore, one of
  the discoverers of the gold-field, before any rush to it had taken place,
  and it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that it was formed prior
  to the deposit of the gravel drift and iron-stained sandstone under which
  it lay. This would indicate a great antiquity of man in Australia, and
  would enable us to account for the fossilised remains of the dingo in
  Pleistocene deposits as those of an animal introduced by man.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_15" href="#NtA_15">[15]</a> Mr. Darwin found that the
  large <i>Helix pomatia</i> lived after immersion in sea-water for twenty
  days. It is hardly likely that this is the extreme limit of their powers
  of endurance, but even this would allow of their being floated many
  hundred miles at a stretch, and if we suppose the shell to be partially
  protected in the crevice of a log of wood, and to be thus out of water in
  calm weather, the distance might extend to a thousand miles or more. The
  eggs of fresh-water mollusca, as well as the young animals, are known to
  attach themselves to the feet of aquatic birds, and this is probably the
  most efficient cause of their very wide diffusion.</p>

  miles from the coast." (<i>Proceedings of the Royal Society</i>, Vol.

  <p><a name="Nt_20" href="#NtA_20">[20]</a> Professor Dana was, I believe,
  the first to point out that the regions which, after long undergoing
  subsidence and accumulating vast piles of sedimentary deposit have been
  elevated into mountain ranges, thereby become stiff and unyielding, and
  that the next depression and subsequent upheaval will be situated on one
  or the other sides of it; and he has shown that, in North America, this
  is the case with all the mountains of the successive geological
  formations. Thus, depressions, and elevations of extreme slowness but
  often of vast amount, have occurred successively in restricted adjacent
  areas; and the effect has been to bring each portion in succession
  beneath the ocean but always bordered on one or both sides by the
  remainder of the continent, from the denudation of which the deposits are
  formed which, on the subsequent upheaval, become mountain ranges.

  <p>This chalk consists simply of comminuted corals and shells of the
  reef. It has been examined microscopically and found to be destitute of
  the minute organisms abounding in the chalk of England. (<i>Geology of
  the United States Exploring Expedition</i>, p. 150.) Mr. Guppy also found
  chalk-like coral limestones containing 95 p.c. of carbonate of lime in
  the Solomon Islands.</p>

  <p>The absence of <i>Globigerinæ</i> is a local phenomenon. They are
  quite absent in the Arafura Sea, and no <i>Globigerina</i>-ooze was found
  in any of the enclosed seas of the Pacific, but with these exceptions the
  <i>Globigerinæ</i> "are really found all over the bottom of the ocean."
  (Murray on Oceanic Deposits&mdash;<i>Proceedings of Royal Society</i>,
  Vol. XXIV., p. 523.)</p>

  <p>The above analysis shows a far closer resemblance to chalk than that
  of the <i>Globigerina</i>-ooze of the Atlantic, four specimens of which
  given by Sir W. Thomson (<i>Voyage of the Challenger</i> Vol. II.
  Appendix, pp. 374-376, Nos. 9, 10, 11 and 12) from the mid-Atlantic, show
  the following proportions:&mdash;</p>

  <p>In addition to the above there is a quantity of insoluble residue
  consisting of small particles of sanidine, augite, hornblende, and
  magnetite, supposed to be the product of volcanic dust or ashes carried
  either in the air or by ocean currents. This volcanic matter amounts to
  from 4.60 to 8.33 per cent. of the <i>Globigerina</i>-ooze of the
  mid-Atlantic, where it seems to be always present; and the small
  proportion of similar matter in true chalk is another proof that its
  origin is different, and that it was deposited far more rapidly than the
  oceanic ooze.</p>

  <p>The large proportion of carbonate of lime, and the very small quantity

  <p><a name="Nt_28" href="#NtA_28">[28]</a> In his lecture on
  <i>Geographical Evolution</i> (which was published after the greater part
  of this chapter had been written) Sir Archibald Geikie expresses views in
  complete accordance with those here advocated. He says:&mdash;"The next
  long era, the Cretaceous, was more remarkable for slow accumulation of
  rock under the sea than for the formation of new land. During that time
  the Atlantic sent its waters across the whole of Europe and into Asia.
  But they were probably nowhere more than a few hundred feet deep over the
  site of our continent, even at their deepest part. Upon their bottom
  there gathered a vast mass of calcareous mud, composed in great part of
  foraminifera, corals, echinoderms, and molluscs. Our English chalk, which
  ranges across the north of France, Belgium, Denmark, and the north of
  Germany, represents a portion of the deposits of that sea-floor." The
  weighty authority of the Director-General of the Geological Survey may
  perhaps cause some geologists to modify their views as to the deep-sea
  origin of chalk, who would have treated any arguments advanced by myself
  as not worthy of consideration.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_29" href="#NtA_29">[29]</a> <i>Introduction and Succession
  of Vertebrate Life in America</i>, by Professor O.&nbsp;C. Marsh. Reprinted
  from the <i>Popular Science Monthly</i>, March, April, 1878.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_30" href="#NtA_30">[30]</a> <i>Physical Geography and
  Geology of Great Britain</i>, 5th Ed. p. 61.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_31" href="#NtA_31">[31]</a> Of late it has been the custom
  to quote the so-called "ridge" down the centre of the Atlantic as
  indicating an extensive ancient land. Even Professor Judd at one time
  adopted this view, speaking of the great belt of Tertiary volcanoes
  "which extended through Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the
  Hebrides, Ireland, Central France, the Iberian Peninsula, the Azores,
  Madeira, Canaries, Cape de Verde Islands, Ascension, St. Helena, and
  Tristan d'Acunha, and which constituted as shown by the recent soundings
  of H.M.S. <i>Challenger</i> a mountain-range, comparable in its extent,
  elevation, and volcanic character with the Andes of South America"
  (<i>Geological Mag.</i> 1874, p. 71). On examining the diagram of the
  Atlantic Ocean in the <i>Challenger Reports</i>, No. 7, a considerable
  part of this ridge is found to be more than 1,900 fathoms deep, while the
  portion called the "Connecting Ridge" seems to be due in part to the
  deposits carried out by the River Amazon. In the neighbourhood of the
  Azores, St. Paul's Rocks, Ascension, and Tristan d'Acunha are
  considerable areas varying from 1,200 to 1,500 fathoms deep, while the
  rest of the ridge is usually 1,800 or 1,900 fathoms. The shallower water
  is no doubt due to volcanic upheaval and the accumulation of volcanic
  ejections, and there may be many other deeply submerged old volcanoes on
  the ridge; but that it ever formed a chain of mountains "comparable in
  elevation with the Andes," there seems not a particle of evidence to
  prove. It is however probable that this ridge indicates the former
  existence of some considerable Atlantic islands, which may serve to
  explain the presence of a few identical genera, and even species of
  plants and insects in Africa and South America, while the main body of
  the fauna and flora of these two continents remains radically
  distinct.</p>

  <p>In my <i>Darwinism</i> (pp. 344-5) I have given an additional argument
  founded on the comparative height and area of land with the depth and
  area of ocean, which seems to me to add considerably to the weight of the
  evidence here submitted for the permanence of oceanic and continental
  areas.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_32" href="#NtA_32">[32]</a> In a review of Mr. T. Mellard
  Reade's <i>Chemical Denudation and Geological Time</i>, in <i>Nature</i>
  (Oct. 2nd, 1879), the writer remarks as follows:&mdash;"One of the funny
  notions of some scientific thinkers meets with no favour from Mr. Reade,
  whose geological knowledge is practical as well as theoretical. They
  consider that because the older rocks contain nothing like the present
  red clays, &amp;c., of the ocean floor, that the oceans have always been
  in their present positions. Mr. Reade points out that the first
  proposition is not yet proved, and the distribution of animals and plants
  and the fact that the bulk of the strata on land are of marine origin are
  opposed to the hypothesis." We must leave it to our readers to decide
  whether the "notion" developed in this chapter is "funny," or whether
  such hasty and superficial arguments as those here quoted from a
  "practical geologist" have any value as against the different classes of
  facts, all pointing to an opposite conclusion, which have now been
  briefly laid before them, supported as they are by the expressed opinion
  of so weighty an authority as Sir Archibald Geikie, who, in the lecture
  already quoted says:&mdash;"From all this evidence we may legitimately
  conclude that the present land of the globe, though formed in great
  measure of marine formations, has never lain under the deep sea; but that
  its site must always have been near land. Even its thick marine
  limestones are the deposits of comparatively shallow water."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_35" href="#NtA_35">[35]</a> This view of the formation of
  "till" is that adopted, by Dr. Geikie, and upheld by almost all the
  Scotch, Swiss, and Scandinavian geologists. The objection however is made
  by many eminent English geologists, including the late Mr. Searles V.
  Wood, Jun., that mud ground off the rocks cannot remain beneath the ice,
  forming sheets of great thickness, because the glacier cannot at the same
  time grind down solid rock and yet pass over the surface of soft mud and
  loose stones. But this difficulty will disappear if we consider the
  numerous fluctuations in the glacier with increasing size, and the
  additions it must have been constantly receiving as the ice from one
  valley after another joined together, and at last produced an ice-sheet
  covering the whole country. The grinding power is the motion and pressure
  of the ice, and the pressure will depend on its thickness. Now the points
  of maximum thickness must have often changed their positions, and the
  result would be that the matter ground out in one place would be forced
  into another place where the pressure was less. If there were no lateral
  escape for the mud, it would necessarily support the ice over it just as
  a water-bed supports the person lying on it; and when there was little
  drainage water, and the ice extended, say, twenty miles in every
  direction from a given part of a valley where the ice was of less than
  the average thickness, the mud would necessarily accumulate at this part
  simply because there was no escape for it. Whenever the pressure all
  round any area was greater than the pressure on that area, the
  <i>débris</i> of the surrounding parts would be forced into it, and would
  even raise up the ice to give it room. This is a necessary result of
  hydrostatic pressure. During this process the superfluous water would no
  doubt escape through fissures or pores of the ice, and would leave the
  mud and stones in that excessively compressed and tenacious condition in
  which the "till" is found. The unequal thickness and pressure of the ice
  above referred to would be a necessary consequence of the inequalities in
  the valleys, now narrowing into gorges, now opening out into wide plains,
  and again narrowed lower down; and it is just in these openings in the
  valleys that the "till" is said to be found, and also in the lowlands
  where an ice-sheet must have extended for many miles in every direction.
  In these lowland valleys the "till" is both thickest and most
  wide-spread, and this is what we might expect. At first, when the
  glaciers from the mountains pushed out into these valleys, they would
  grind out the surface beneath them into hollows, and the drainage-water
  would carry away the <i>débris</i>. But when they spread all over the
  surface from sea to sea, and there was little or no drainage water
  compared to the enormous area covered with ice, the great bulk of the
  <i>débris</i> must have gathered under the ice wherever the pressure was
  least, and the ice would necessarily rise as it accumulated. Some of the
  mud would no doubt be forced out along lines of least resistance to the
  sea, but the friction of the stone-charged "till" would be so enormous
  that it would be impossible for any large part of it to be disposed of in
  this way.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_36" href="#NtA_36">[36]</a> That the ice-sheet was
  continuous from Scotland to Ireland is proved by the glacial phenomena in
  the Isle of Man, where "till" similar to that in Scotland abounds, and
  rocks are found in it which must have come from Cumberland and Scotland,
  as well as from the north of Ireland. This would show that glaciers from
  each of these districts reached the Isle of Man, where they met and
  flowed southwards down the Irish Sea. Ice-marks are traced over the tops
  of the mountains which are nearly 2,000 feet high. (See <i>A Sketch of
  the Geology of the Isle of Man</i>, by John Horne, F.G.S. <i>Trans. of

  <p><a name="Nt_45" href="#NtA_45">[45]</a> In a letter to <i>Nature</i>
  of October 30th, 1879, the Rev. O. Fisher calls attention to a result
  arrived at by Pouillet, that the temperature which the surface of the
  ground would assume if the sun were extinguished would be -128° F.
  instead of -239° F. If this corrected amount were used in our
  calculations, the January temperature of England during the glacial epoch
  would come out 17° F., and this Mr. Fisher thinks not low enough to cause
  any extreme difference from the present climate. In this opinion,
  however, I cannot agree with him. On the contrary, it would, I think, be
  a relief to the theory were the amounts of decrease of temperature in
  winter and increase in summer rendered more moderate, since according to
  the usual calculation (which I have adopted) the differences are
  unnecessarily great. I cannot therefore think that this modification of
  the temperatures, should it be ultimately proved to be correct (which is
  altogether denied by Dr. Croll), would be any serious objection to the
  adoption of Dr. Croll's theory of the Astronomical and Physical causes of
  the Glacial Epoch.</p>

  <p>The reason of the theoretical increase of summer heat being greater
  than the decrease of winter cold is because we are now nearest the sun in
  winter and farthest in summer, whereas we calculate the temperatures of
  the glacial epoch for the phase of precession when the <i>aphelion</i>
  was in winter. A large part of the increase of temperature would no doubt
  be used up in melting ice and evaporating water, so that there would be a
  much less increase of sensible heat; while only a portion of the
  theoretical lowering of temperature in winter would be actually produced
  owing to equalising effect of winds and currents, and the storing up of
  heat by the earth and ocean.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_46" href="#NtA_46">[46]</a> Dr. Croll says this "is one of
  the most widespread and fundamental errors within the whole range of
  geological climatology." The temperature of the snow itself is, he says,
  one of the main factors. (<i>Climate and Cosmology</i>, p. 85.) But
  surely the temperature of the snow must depend on the temperature of the
  air through which it falls.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_47" href="#NtA_47">[47]</a> In an account of Prof.
  Nordenskjöld's recent expedition round the northern coast of Asia, given
  in <i>Nature</i>, November 20th, 1879, we have the following passage,
  fully supporting the statement in the text. "Along the whole coast, from
  the White Sea to Behring's Straits, no glacier was seen. During autumn
  the Siberian coast is nearly free of ice and snow. There are no mountains
  covered all the year round with snow, although some of them rise to a
  height of more than 2,000 feet." It must be remembered that the north
  coast of Eastern Siberia is in the area of supposed greatest winter cold
  on the globe.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_48" href="#NtA_48">[48]</a> Dr. Croll objects to this
  argument on the ground that Greenland and the Antarctic continent are
  probably lowlands or groups of islands. (<i>Climate and Cosmology</i>,
  Chap. V.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_49" href="#NtA_49">[49]</a> "On the Glacial Epoch," by
  James Croll. <i>Geol. Mag.</i> July, August, 1874.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_50" href="#NtA_50">[50]</a> "The general absence of recent
  marks of glacial action in Eastern Europe is well known; and the series
  of changes which have been so well traced and described by Prof. Szabó as
  occurring in those districts seems to leave no room for those periodical
  extensions of 'ice-caps' with which some authors in this country have
  amused themselves and their readers. Mr. Campbell, whose ability to
  recognise the physical evidence of glaciers will scarcely be questioned,
  finds quite the same absence of the proof of extensive ice-action in
  North America, westward of the meridian of Chicago." (Prof. J.&nbsp;W. Judd in
  <i>Geol. Mag.</i> 1876, p. 535.)</p>

  <p>The same author notes the diminution of marks of ice-action on going
  eastward in the Alps; and the Altai Mountains far in Central Asia show no
  signs of having been largely glaciated. West of the Rocky Mountains,
  however, in the Sierra Nevada and the coast ranges further north, signs
  of extensive old glaciers again appear; all which phenomena are
  strikingly in accordance with the theory here advocated, of the absolute
  dependence of glaciation on abundant rainfall and elevated
  snow-condensers and accumulators.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_51" href="#NtA_51">[51]</a> I have somewhat modified this
  whole passage in the endeavour to represent more accurately the
  difference between the views of Dr. Croll and Sir Charles Lyell.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_52" href="#NtA_52">[52]</a> For numerous details and
  illustrations see the paper&mdash;"On Ocean Currents in Relation to the
  Physical Theory of Secular Changes of Climate"&mdash;in the
  <i>Philosophical Magazine</i>, 1870.</p>

  Voyage Round the World</i>, 2nd Edition, pp. 244-251.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_54" href="#NtA_54">[54]</a> The influence of geographical
  changes on climate is now held by many geologists who oppose what they
  consider the extravagant hypotheses of Dr. Croll. Thus, Prof. Dana
  imputes the glacial epoch chiefly, if not wholly, to elevation of the
  land caused by the lateral pressure due to shrinking of the earth's crust
  that has caused all other elevations and depressions. He says: "Now, that
  elevation of the land over the higher latitudes which brought on the
  glacial era is a natural result of the same agency, and a natural, and
  almost necessary, counterpart of the coral-island subsidence which must
  have been then in progress. The accumulating, folding, solidification,
  and crystallisation of rocks attending all the rock-making and
  mountain-making through the Palæozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras, had
  greatly stiffened the crust in these parts; and hence in after times, the
  continental movements resulting from the lateral pressure necessarily
  appeared over the more northern portions of the continent, where the
  accumulations and other changes had been relatively small. To the
  subsidence which followed the elevation the weight of the ice-cap may
  have contributed in some small degree. But the great balancing movements
  of the crust of the continental and oceanic areas then going forward must
  have had a greatly preponderating effect in the oscillating agency of all
  time&mdash;lateral pressure within the crust." (<i>American Journal of
  Science and Arts</i>, 3rd Series, Vol. IX. p. 318.)</p>

  <p>"In the 2nd edition of his <i>Manual of Geology</i>, Professor Dana
  suggests elevation of Arctic lands sufficient to exclude the Gulf Stream,
  as a source of cold during glacial epochs. This, he thinks, would have
  made an epoch of cold at any era of the globe. A deep submergence of
  Behring's Strait, letting in the Pacific warm current to the polar area,
  would have produced a mild Arctic climate like that of the Miocene
  period. When the warm current was shut out from the polar area it would
  yet reach near to it, and bring with it that abundant moisture necessary
  for glaciation." (<i>Manual of Geology</i>, 2nd Edition, pp. 541-755,
  756.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_55" href="#NtA_55">[55]</a> Dana's <i>Manual of
  Geology</i>, 2nd Edition, p. 540.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_56" href="#NtA_56">[56]</a> Dr. Croll says that I here
  assume an impossible state of things. He maintains "that the change from
  the distant sun in winter, and near sun in summer to the near sun in
  winter and distant sun in summer, aided by the change in the physical
  causes which this would necessarily bring about, would certainly be
  sufficient to cause the snow and ice to disappear." (<i>Climate and
  Cosmology</i>, p. 106.) But I demur to his "necessarily." It is not the
  <i>direct</i> effect of the nearer sun in winter that is supposed to melt
  the snow and ice, but the "physical causes," such as absence of fogs and
  increase of warm equatorial currents. But the near sun in winter acting
  on an ice-clad surface would only increase the fogs and snow, while the
  currents could only change if a large portion of the ice were first
  melted, in which case they would no doubt be modified so as to cause a
  further melting of the ice. Dr. Croll says: "The warm and equable
  conditions of climate which would then prevail, and the enormous quantity
  of intertropical water carried into the Southern Ocean, would soon
  produce a melting of the ice." (<i>Loc. cit.</i> p. 111.) This seems to
  me to be assuming the very point at issue. He has himself shown that the
  presence of large quantities of ice prevents "a warm and equable climate"
  however great may be the sun-heat; the ice therefore would <i>not</i> be
  melted, and there would be no increased flow of intertropical water to
  the Southern Ocean. The ocean currents are mainly due to the difference
  of temperature of the polar and equatorial areas combined with the
  peculiar form and position of the continents, and some one or more of
  these factors must be altered <i>before</i> the ocean currents towards
  the north pole can be increased. The only factor available is the
  Antarctic ice, and if this were largely increased, the northward-flowing
  currents might be so increased as to melt some of the Arctic ice. But the
  very same argument applies to both poles. Without some geographical
  change the Antarctic ice could not materially diminish during its winter
  in <i>perihelion</i>, nor increase to any important extent during the
  opposite phase. We therefore seem to have no available agency by which to
  get rid of the ice over a glaciated hemisphere, <i>so long as the
  geographical conditions remained unchanged and the excentricity continued
  high</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_57" href="#NtA_57">[57]</a> In the <i>Geological
  Magazine</i>, April, 1880, Mr. Searles V. Wood adduces what he considers
  to be the "conclusive objection" to Dr. Croll's excentricity theory,
  which is, that during the last glacial epoch Europe and North America
  were glaciated very much in proportion to their respective climates now,
  which are generally admitted to be due to the distribution of oceanic
  currents. But Dr. Croll admits his theory "to be baseless unless there
  was a complete diversion of the warm ocean currents from the hemisphere
  glaciated," in which case there ought to be no difference in the extent
  of glaciation in Europe and North America. Whether or not this is a
  correct statement of Dr. Croll's theory, the above objection certainly
  does not apply to the views here advocated; but as I also hold the
  "excentricity theory" in a modified form, it may be as well to show why
  it does not apply. In the first place I do not believe that the Gulf
  Stream was "completely diverted" during the glacial epoch, but that it
  was diminished in force, and (as described at p. <a
  href="#page144">144</a>) <i>partly</i> diverted southward. A portion of
  its influence would, however, still remain to cause a difference between
  the climates of the two sides of the Atlantic; and to this must be added
  two other causes&mdash;the far greater penetration of warm sea-water into
  the European than into the North American continent, and the proximity to
  America of the enormous ice-producing mass of Greenland. We have thus
  three distinct causes, all combining to produce a more severe winter
  climate on the west than on the east of the Atlantic during the glacial
  epoch, and though the first of these&mdash;the Gulf Stream&mdash;was not
  nearly so powerful as it is now, neither is the difference indicated by
  the ice-extension in the two countries so great as the present difference
  of winter-temperature, which is the essential point to be considered. The
  ice-sheet of the United States is usually supposed to have extended about
  ten, or, at most, twelve, degrees further south than it did in Western
  Europe, whereas we must go twenty degrees further south in the former
  country to obtain the same mean winter-temperature we find in the latter,
  as may be seen by examining any map of winter isothermals. This
  difference very fairly corresponds to the difference of conditions
  existing during the glacial epoch and the present time, so far as we are
  able to estimate them, and it certainly affords no grounds of objection
  to the theory by which the glaciation is here explained.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_58" href="#NtA_58">[58]</a> Dr. Croll objects to this
  argument, and adduces the case of Greenland as showing that ice may
  accumulate far from sea. But the width of Greenland is small compared
  with that of the supposed Antarctic ice-cap. (<i>Climate and
  Cosmology</i>, p. 78.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_59" href="#NtA_59">[59]</a> The recent extensive
  glaciation of New Zealand is generally imputed by the local geologists to
  a greater elevation of the land; but I cannot help believing that the
  high phase of excentricity which caused our own glacial epoch was at all
  events an assisting cause. This is rendered more probable if taken in
  connection with the following very definite statement of glacial markings
  in South Africa. Captain Aylward in his <i>Transvaal of To-day</i> (p.
  171) says:&mdash;"It will be interesting to geologists and others to
  learn that the entire country, from the summits of the Quathlamba to the
  junction of the Vaal and Orange rivers, shows marks of having been swept
  over, and that at no very distant period, by vast masses of ice from east
  to west. The striations are plainly visible, scarring the older rocks,
  and marking the hill-sides&mdash;getting lower and lower and less visible
  as, descending from the mountains, the kopjies (small hills) stand wider
  apart; but wherever the hills narrow towards each other, again showing
  how the vast ice-fields were checked, thrown up, and raised against their
  Eastern extremities."</p>

  <p>This passage is evidently written by a person familiar with the
  phenomena of glaciation, and as Captain Aylward's preface is dated from
  Edinburgh, he has probably seen similar markings in Scotland. The country
  described consists of the most extensive and lofty plateau in South
  Africa, rising to a mountain knot with peaks more than 10,000 feet high,
  thus offering an appropriate area for the condensation of vapour and the
  accumulation of snow. At present, however, the mountains do not reach the
  snow-line, and there is no proof that they have been much higher in
  recent times, since the coast of Natal is now said to be rising. It is
  evident that no slight elevation would now lead to the accumulation of
  snow and ice in these mountains, situated as they are between 27° and 30°
  S. Lat.; since the Andes, which in 32° S. Lat. reach 23,300 feet high,
  and in 28° S. Lat. 20,000, with far more extensive plateaus, produce no
  ice-fields. We cannot, therefore, believe that a few thousand feet of
  additional elevation, even if it occurred so recently as indicated by the
  presence of striations, would have produced the remarkable amount of
  glaciation above described; while from the analogy of the northern
  hemisphere, we may well believe that it was mainly due to the same high
  excentricity that led to the glaciation of Western and Central Europe,
  and Eastern North America.</p>

  <p>These observations confirm those of Mr. G.&nbsp;W. Stow, who, in a paper
  published in the <i>Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society</i> (Vol.
  <span class="scac">XXVII.</span> p. 539), describes similar phenomena in
  the same mountains, and also mounds and ridges of unstratified clay
  packed with angular boulders; while further south the Stormberg mountains
  are said to be similarly glaciated, with immense accumulations of
  morainic matter in all the valleys. We have here most of the surface
  phenomena characteristic of a glaciated country, only a few degrees south
  of the tropic; and taken in connection with the indications of recent
  glaciation in New Zealand, and those discovered by Dr. R. von Lendenfeld
  in the Australian Alps between 6,000 and 7,000 feet elevation
  (<i>Nature</i>, Vol. <span class="scac">XXXII.</span> p. 69), we can
  hardly doubt the occurrence of some general and wide-spread cause of
  glaciation in the southern hemisphere at a period so recent that the
  superficial phenomena are almost as well preserved as in Europe. Other
  geologists however deny that there are any distinct indications of
  glacial action in South Africa; but the recent discovery by Dr. J.&nbsp;W.
  Gregory, F.G.S., of the former extension of glaciers on Mount Kenya 5,000
  feet below their present limits, renders probable the former glaciation
  of the South African Highlands.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_60" href="#NtA_60">[60]</a> The astronomical facts
  connected with the motions and appearance of the planet are taken from a
  paper by Mr. Edward Carpenter, M.A., in the <i>Geological Magazine</i> of
  March, 1877, entitled, "Evidence Afforded by Mars on the Subject of
  Glacial Periods," but I arrive at somewhat different conclusions from
  those of the writer of the paper.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_61" href="#NtA_61">[61]</a> In an article in <i>Nature</i>
  of Jan. 1, 1880, the Rev. T.&nbsp;W. Webb states that in 1877 the pole of Mars
  (? the south pole) was, according to Schiaparelli, entirely free of snow.
  He remarks also on the regular contour of the supposed snows of Mars as
  offering a great contrast to ours, and also the strongly marked dark
  border which has often been observed. On the whole Mr. Webb seems to be
  of opinion that there can be no really close resemblance between the
  physical condition of the Earth and Mars, and that any arguments founded
  on such supposed similarity are therefore untrustworthy.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_65" href="#NtA_65">[65]</a> Prof. J.&nbsp;W. Judd says: "In the
  case of the Alps I know of no glacial phenomena which are not capable of
  being explained, like those of New Zealand, by a great extension of the
  area of the tracts above the snow-line which would collect more ample
  supplies for the glaciers protruded into surrounding plains. And when we
  survey the grand panoramas of ridges, pinnacles, and peaks produced for
  the most part by sub-aërial action, we may well be prepared to admit that
  before the intervening ravines and valleys were excavated, the glaciers
  shed from the elevated plateaux must have been of vastly greater
  magnitude than at present." (Contributions to the Study of Volcanoes,
  <i>Geological Magazine</i>, 1876, p. 536.) Professor Judd applies these
  remarks to the last as well as to previous glacial periods in the Alps;
  but surely there has been no such extensive alteration and lowering of
  the surface of the country since the erratic blocks were deposited on the
  Jura and the great moraines formed in North Italy, as this theory would
  imply. We can hardly suppose wide areas to have been lowered thousands of
  feet by denudation, and yet have left other adjacent areas apparently
  untouched; and it is even very doubtful whether such an extension of the
  snow-fields would alone suffice for the effects which were certainly
  produced.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_72" href="#NtA_72">[72]</a> It is interesting to observe
  that the Cretaceous flora of the United States (that of the Dakota
  group), indicates a somewhat cooler climate than that of the following
  Eocene period. Mr. De Rance (in the geological appendix to Capt. Sir G.
  Nares's <i>Narrative of a Voyage to the Polar Sea</i>) remarks as
  follows: "In the overlying American Eocenes occur types of plants
  occurring in the European Miocenes and still living, proving the truth of
  Professor Lesquereux's postulate, that the plant types appear in America
  a stage in advance of their advent in Europe. These plants point to a far
  higher mean temperature than those of the Dakota group, to a dense
  atmosphere of vapour, and a luxuriance of ferns and palms." This is very
  important as adding further proof to the view that the climates of former
  periods are not due to any general refrigeration, but to causes which
  were subject to change and alternation in former ages as now.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_73" href="#NtA_73">[73]</a> Mr. S.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;J. Skertchley
  informs me that he has himself observed thick Tertiary deposits,
  consisting of clays and anhydrous gypsum, at Berenice on the borders of
  Egypt and Nubia, at a height of about 600 feet above the sea-level; but
  these may have been of fresh-water origin.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_74" href="#NtA_74">[74]</a> By referring to our map of the
  Indian Ocean showing the submarine banks indicating ancient islands
  (Chap. XIX.), it will be evident that the south-east
  trade-winds&mdash;then exceptionally powerful&mdash;would cause a vast
  body of water to enter the deep Arabian Sea.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_75" href="#NtA_75">[75]</a> In his recently published
  <i>Lectures on Physical Geography</i>, Professor Haughton calculates,
  that more than half the solar heat of the torrid zone is carried to the
  temperate zones by ocean currents. The Gulf Stream itself carries
  one-twelfth of the total amount, but it is probable that a very small
  fraction of this quantity of heat reaches the polar seas owing to the
  wide area over which the current spreads in the North Atlantic. The
  corresponding stream of the Indian Ocean in Miocene times would have been
  fully equal to the Gulf Stream in heating power, while, owing to its
  being so much more concentrated, a large proportion of its heat may have
  reached the polar area. But the Arctic Ocean occupies less than one-tenth
  of the area of the tropical seas; so that, whatever proportion of the
  heat of the tropical zone was conveyed to it, would, by being
  concentrated into one-tenth of the surface, produce an enormously
  increased effect. Taking this into consideration, we can hardly doubt
  that the opening of a sufficient passage from the Indian Ocean to the
  Arctic seas would produce the effects above indicated.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_77" href="#NtA_77">[77]</a> Professor Haughton has made an
  elaborate calculation of the difference between existing climates and
  those of Miocene times, for all the places where a Miocene flora has been
  discovered, by means of the actual range of corresponding species and
  genera of plants. Although this method is open to the objection that the
  ranges of plants and animals are not determined by temperature only, yet
  the results may be approximately correct, and are very interesting. The
  following table which summarizes these results is taken from his Lectures
  on Physical Geography (p. 344):&mdash;</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that Iceland, which is now exposed to the
  full influence of the Gulf Stream, was only 12°.6 F. warmer in Miocene
  times, while Mackenzie River, now totally removed from its influence was
  28° warmer. This, as well as, the greater increase of temperature as we
  go northward and the polar area becomes more limited, is quite in
  accordance with the view of the causes which brought about the Miocene
  climate which is here advocated.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_78" href="#NtA_78">[78]</a> The objection has been made,
  that the long polar night would of itself be fatal to the existence of
  such a luxuriant vegetation as we know to have existed as far as 80° N.
  Lat., and that there must have been some alteration of the position of
  the pole, or diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic, to permit such
  plants as magnolias and large-leaved maples to flourish. But there
  appears to be really no valid grounds for such an objection. Not only are
  numbers of Alpine and Arctic evergreens deeply buried in the snow for
  many months without injury, but a variety of tropical and sub-tropical
  plants are preserved in the hot-houses of St. Petersburg and other
  northern cities, which are closely matted during winter, and are thus
  exposed to as much darkness as the night of the Arctic regions. We have
  besides no proof that any of the Arctic trees or large shrubs were
  evergreens, and the darkness would certainly not be prejudical to
  deciduous plants. With a suitable temperature there is nothing to prevent
  a luxuriant vegetation up to the pole, and the long continued day is
  known to be highly favourable to the development of foliage, which in the
  same species is larger and better developed in Norway than in the south
  of England.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_86" href="#NtA_86">[86]</a> It has usually been the
  practice to take the amount of denudation in the Mississippi valley, or
  one foot in six thousand years, as a measure of the rate of denudation in
  Europe, from an idea apparently of being on the "safe side," and of not
  over-estimating the rate of change. But this appears to me a most
  unphilosophical mode of proceeding and unworthy of scientific inquiry.
  What should we think of astronomers if they always took the lowest
  estimates of planetary or stellar distances, instead of the mean results
  of observation, "in order to be on the safe side!"? As if error in one
  direction were any worse than error in another. Yet this is what
  geologists do systematically. Whenever any calculations are made
  involving the antiquity of man, it is those that give the <i>lowest</i>
  results that are always taken, for no reason apparently except that there
  was, for so long a time, a prejudice, both popular and scientific,
  against the great antiquity of man; and now that a means has been found
  of measuring the rate of denudation, they take the slowest rate instead
  of the mean rate, apparently only because there is now a scientific
  prejudice in favour of extremely slow geological change. I take the mean
  of the whole; and as this is almost exactly the same as the mean of the
  three great European rivers&mdash;the Rhone, Danube, and Po&mdash;I
  cannot believe that this will not be nearer the truth for Europe than
  taking one North American river as the standard.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_87" href="#NtA_87">[87]</a> "On the Height of the Land and
  the Depth of the Ocean," in the <i>Scottish Geographical Magazine</i>,
  1888.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_88" href="#NtA_88">[88]</a> These figures are merely used
  to give an idea of the rate at which denudation is actually going on now;
  but if no elevatory forces were at work, the rate of denudation would
  certainly diminish as the mountains were lowered and the slope of the
  ground everywhere rendered flatter. This would follow not only from the
  diminished power of rain and rivers, but because the climate would become
  more uniform, the rainfall probably less, and no rocky peaks would be
  left to be fractured and broken up by the action of frosts. It is
  certain, however, that no continent has ever remained long subject to the
  influences of denudation alone, for, as we have seen in our sixth
  chapter, elevation and depression have always been going on in one part
  or other of the surface.</p>

  <p>We thus find that over a wide area, extending from London to Ware and
  Harwich, the whole of the formations from the Oolite to the Permian are
  wanting, the Cretaceous resting on the Carboniferous or older Palæozoic
  rocks; and the same deficiency extends across to Belgium, where the
  Tertiary beds are found resting on Carboniferous at a depth of less than
  400 feet.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_90" href="#NtA_90">[90]</a> <i>Geological Magazine</i>,
  Vol. VIII., March, 1871.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_91" href="#NtA_91">[91]</a> Mr. C. Lloyd Morgan has well
  illustrated this point by comparing the generally tilted-up strata
  denuded on their edges, to a library in which a fire had acted on the
  exposed edges of the books, destroying a great mass of literature but
  leaving a portion of each book in its place, which portion represents the
  thickness but not the size of the book. (<i>Geological Magazine</i>,
  1878, p. 161.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_92" href="#NtA_92">[92]</a> Professor J. Young thinks it
  highly probable that&mdash;"the Lower Greensand is contemporaneous with
  part of the Chalk, so were parts of the Wealden; nay, even of the Purbeck
  a portion must have been forming while the Cretaceous sea was gradually
  deepening southward and westward." Yet these deposits are always arranged
  successively, and their several thicknesses added together to obtain the
  total thickness of the formations of the country. (See Presidential
  Address, Sect. C. British Association, 1876.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_93" href="#NtA_93">[93]</a> Mr. John Murray in his more
  careful estimate makes it about 51½ millions.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_94" href="#NtA_94">[94]</a> As by far the larger portion
  of the denuded matter of the globe passes to the sea through
  comparatively few great rivers, the deposits must often be confined to
  very limited areas. Thus the denudation of the vast Mississippi basin
  must be almost all deposited in a limited portion of the Gulf of Mexico,
  that of the Nile within a small area of the Eastern Mediterranean, and
  that of the great rivers of China&mdash;the Hoang Ho and Yang-tse-kiang,
  in a small portion of the Eastern Sea. Enormous lengths of coast, like
  those of Western America and Eastern Africa, receive very scanty
  deposits; so that thirty miles in width along the whole of the coasts of
  the globe will probably give an area greater than that of the area of
  <i>average</i> deposit, and certainly greater than that of <i>maximum</i>
  deposit, which is the basis on which I have here made my estimates. In
  the case of the Mississippi, it is stated by Count Pourtales that along
  the plateau between the mouth of the river and the southern extremity of
  Florida for two hundred and fifty miles in width the bottom consists of
  clay with some sand and but few Rhizopods; but beyond this distance the
  soundings brought up either Rhizopod shells alone, or these mixed with
  coral sand, Nullipores, and other calcareous organisms (Dana's <i>Manual
  of Geology</i>, 2nd Ed. p. 671). It is probable, therefore, that a large
  proportion of the entire mass of sediment brought down by the Mississippi
  is deposited on the limited area above indicated.</p>

  <p>Professor Dana further remarks: "Over interior oceanic basins as well
  as off a coast in quiet depths, fifteen or twenty fathoms and beyond, the
  deposits are mostly of fine silt, fitted for making fine argillaceous
  rocks, as shales or slates. When, however, the depth of the ocean falls
  off below a hundred fathoms, the deposition of silt in our existing
  oceans mostly ceases, unless in the case of a great bank along the border
  of a continent."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_95" href="#NtA_95">[95]</a> From the same data Professor
  Haughton estimates a minimum of 200 million years for the duration of
  geological time; but he arrives at this conclusion by supposing the
  products of denudation to be uniformly spread over the <i>whole
  sea-bottom</i> instead of over a narrow belt near the coasts, a
  supposition entirely opposed to all the known facts, and which had been
  shown by Dr. Croll, five years previously, to be altogether erroneous.
  (See <i>Nature</i>, Vol. XVIII., p. 268, where Professor Haughton's paper
  is given as read before the Royal Society.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_96" href="#NtA_96">[96]</a> See <i>Geological Magazine</i>
  for 1877, p. 1.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_97" href="#NtA_97">[97]</a> In his reply to Sir W.
  Thomson, Professor Huxley <i>assumed</i> one foot in a thousand years as
  a not improbable rate of deposition. The above estimate indicates a far
  higher rate; and this follows from the well-ascertained fact, that the
  area of deposition is many times smaller than the area of denudation.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_98" href="#NtA_98">[98]</a> Dr. Croll and Sir Archibald
  Geikie have shown that marine denudation is very small in amount as
  compared with sub-aërial, since it acts only locally on the <i>edge</i>
  of the land, whereas the latter acts over every foot of the
  <i>surface</i>. Mr. W.&nbsp;T. Blanford argues that the difference is still
  greater in tropical than in temperate latitudes, and arrives at the
  conclusion that&mdash;"If over British India the effects of marine to
  those of fresh-water denudation in removing the rocks of the country be
  estimated at 1 to 100, I believe that the result of marine action will be
  greatly overstated" (<i>Geology and Zoology of Abyssinia</i>, p. 158,
  note). Now, as our estimate of the rate of sub-aërial denudation cannot
  pretend to any precise accuracy, we are justified in neglecting marine
  denudation altogether, especially as we have no method of estimating it
  for the whole earth with any approach to correctness.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_99" href="#NtA_99">[99]</a> Agassiz appears to have been
  the first to suggest that the principal epochs of life extermination were
  epochs of cold; and Dana thinks that two at least such epochs may be
  recognised, at the close of the Palæozoic and of the Cretaceous
  periods&mdash;to which we may add the last glacial epoch.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_100" href="#NtA_100">[100]</a> This view was, I believe,
  first put forth by myself in a paper read before the Geological Section
  of the British Association in 1869, and subsequently in an article in
  <i>Nature</i>, Vol. I. p. 454. It was also stated by Mr. <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `S.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;K.'.">S.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;J.</span>
  Skertchley in his <i>Physical System of the Universe</i>, p. 363 (1878);
  but we both founded it on what I now consider the erroneous doctrine that
  actual glacial epochs recurred each 10,500 years during periods of high
  excentricity.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_104" href="#NtA_104">[104]</a> Some of Mr. Darwin's
  experiments are very interesting and suggestive. Ripe hazel-nuts sank
  immediately, but when dried they floated for ninety days, and afterwards
  germinated. An asparagus-plant with ripe berries, when dried, floated for
  eighty-five days, and the seeds afterwards germinated. Out of ninety-four
  dried plants experimented with, eighteen floated for more than a month,
  and some for three months, and their powers of germination seem never to
  have been wholly destroyed. Now, as oceanic currents vary from thirty to
  sixty miles a day, such plants under the most favourable conditions might
  be carried 90 X 60 = 5,400 miles! But even half of this is ample to
  enable them to reach any oceanic island, and we must remember that till
  completely water-logged they might be driven along at a much greater rate
  by the wind. Mr. Darwin calculates the distance by the average time of
  flotation to be 924 miles; but in such a case as this we are entitled to
  take the extreme cases, because such countless thousands of plants and
  seeds must be carried out to sea annually that the extreme cases in a
  single experiment with only ninety-four plants, must happen hundreds or
  thousands of times and with hundreds or thousands of species, naturally,
  and thus afford ample opportunities for successful migration. (See
  <i>Origin of Species</i>, 6th Edition, p. 325.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_105" href="#NtA_105">[105]</a> The following remarks,
  kindly communicated to me by Mr. H.&nbsp;N. Moseley, naturalist to the
  <i>Challenger</i>, throw much light on the agency of birds in the
  distribution of plants:&mdash;"Grisebach (<i>Veg. der Erde</i>, Vol. II.
  p. 496) lays much stress on the wide ranging of the albatross (Diomedea)
  across the equator from Cape Horn to the Kurile Islands, and thinks that
  the presence of the same plants in Arctic and Antarctic regions may be
  accounted for, possibly, by this fact. I was much struck at Marion Island
  of the Prince Edward group, by observing that the great albatross breeds
  in the midst of a dense, low herbage, and constructs its nest of a mound
  of turf and herbage. Some of the indigenous plants, <i>e.g.</i> Acæna,
  have flower-heads which stick like burrs to feathers, &amp;c., and seem
  specially adapted for transposition by birds. Besides the albatrosses,
  various species of Procellaria and Puffinus, birds which range over
  immense distances may, I think, have played a great part in the
  distribution of plants, and especially account, in some measure, for the
  otherwise difficult fact (when occurring in the tropics), that widely
  distant islands have similar mountain plants. The Procellaria and
  Puffinus in nesting, burrow in the ground, as far as I have seen choosing
  often places where the vegetation is the thickest. The birds in burrowing
  get their feathers covered with vegetable mould, which must include
  spores, and often seeds. In high latitudes the birds often burrow near
  the sea-level, as at Tristan d'Acunha or Kerguelen's Land, but in the
  tropics they choose the mountains for their nesting-place (Finsch and
  Hartlaub, <i>Orn. der Viti- und Tonga-Inseln</i>, 1867, Einleitung, p.
  xviii.). Thus, <i>Puffinus megasi</i> nests at the top of the Korobasa
  basaga mountain, Viti Levu, fifty miles from the sea. A Procellaria
  breeds in like manner in the high mountains of Jamaica, I believe at
  7,000 feet. Peale describes the same habit of <i>Procellaria rostrata</i>
  at Tahiti, and I saw the burrows myself amidst a dense growth of fern,
  &amp;c., at 4,400 feet elevation in that island. Phaethon has a similar
  habit. It nests at the crater of Kilauea, Hawaii, at 4,000 feet
  elevation, and also high up in Tahiti. In order to account for the <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `transporation'."
  >transportation</span> of the plants, it is not of course necessary that
  the same species of Procellaria or Diomedea should now range between the
  distant points where the plants occur. The ancestor of the now differing
  species might have carried the seeds. The range of the genus is
  sufficient."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_107" href="#NtA_107">[107]</a> "The late Sir C. Wyville
  Thomson was of opinion that the 'red earth' which largely forms the soil
  of Bermuda had an organic origin, as well as the 'red clay' which the
  <i>Challenger</i> discovered in all the greater depths of the ocean
  basins. He regarded the red earth and red clay as an ash left behind
  after the gradual removal of the lime by water charged with carbonic
  acid. This ash he regarded as a constituent part of the shells of
  Foraminifera, skeletons of Corals, and Molluscs, [<i>vide</i> <i>Voyage
  of the Challenger</i>, Atlantic, Vol. I. p. 316]. This theory does not
  seem to be in any way tenable. Analysis of carefully selected shells of
  Foraminifera, Heteropods, and Pteropods, did not show the slightest trace
  of alumina, and none has as yet been discovered in coral skeletons. It is
  most probable that a large part of the clayey matter found in red clay
  and the red earth of Bermuda is derived from the disintegration of
  pumice, which is continually found floating on the surface of the sea.
  [See Murray, "On the Distribution of Volcanic Débris Over the Floor of
  the Ocean;" <i>Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin.</i> Vol. IX. pp. 247-261.
  1876-1877.] The naturalists of the <i>Challenger</i> found it among the
  floating masses of gulf weed, and it is frequently picked up on the reefs
  of Bermuda and other coral islands. The red earth contains a good many
  fragments of magnetite, augite, felspar, and glassy fragments, and when a
  large quantity of the rock of Bermuda is dissolved away with acid, a
  small number of fragments are also met with. These mineral particles most
  probably came originally from the pumice which had been cast up on the
  island for long ages (for it is known that these minerals are present in
  pumice), although possibly some of them may have come from the volcanic
  rock, which is believed to form the nucleus of the island." <i>The Voyage

  <p><a name="Nt_114" href="#NtA_114">[114]</a> Mr. H.&nbsp;O. Forbes, who
  visited these islands in 1878, increased the number of wild plants to
  thirty-six, and these belonged to twenty-six natural orders.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_115" href="#NtA_115">[115]</a> Juan Fernandez is a good
  example of a small island which, with time and favourable conditions, has
  acquired a tolerably rich and highly peculiar flora and fauna. It is
  situated in 34° S. Lat., 400 miles from the coast of Chile, and so far as
  facilities for the transport of living organisms are concerned is by no
  means in a favourable position, for the ocean-currents come from the
  south-west in a direction where there is no land but the Antarctic
  continent, and the prevalent winds are also westerly. No doubt, however,
  there are occasional storms, and there may have been intermediate
  islands, but its chief advantages are its antiquity, its varied surface,
  and its favourable soil and climate, offering many chances for the
  preservation and increase of whatever plants and animals have chanced to
  reach it. The island consists of basalt, greenstone, and other ancient
  rocks, and though only about twelve miles long its mountains are three
  thousand feet high. Enjoying a moist and temperate climate it is
  especially adapted to the growth of ferns, which are very abundant; and
  as the spores of these plants are as fine as dust, and very easily
  carried for enormous distances by winds, it is not surprising that there
  are nearly fifty species on the island, while the remote period when it
  first received its vegetation may be indicated by the fact that nearly
  half the species are quite peculiar; while of 102 species of flowering
  plants seventy are peculiar, and there are ten peculiar genera. The same
  general character pervades the fauna. For so small an island it is rich,
  containing four true land-birds, about fifty species of insects, and
  twenty of land-shells. Almost all these belong to South American genera,
  and a large proportion are South American species; but several of the
  insects, half the birds, and the whole of the land-shells are peculiar.
  This seems to indicate that the means of transmission were formerly
  greater than they are now, and that in the case of land-shells none have
  been introduced for so long a period that all have become modified into
  distinct forms, or have been preserved on the island while they have
  become extinct on the continent. For a detailed examination of the causes
  which have led to the modification of the humming birds of Juan Fernandez
  see the chapter on Humming Birds in the author's <i>Natural Selection and
  Tropical Nature</i>, p. 324; while a general account of the fauna of the
  island is given in his <i>Geographical Distribution of Animals</i>, Vol.
  II. p. 49.</p>

  interesting work entitled <i>The Earth as Modified by Human Action</i>
  (p. 51), thus remarks on the effect of browsing quadrupeds in destroying
  and checking woody vegetation.&mdash;"I am convinced that forests would
  soon cover many parts of the Arabian and African deserts if man and
  domestic animals, especially the goat and the camel, were banished from
  them. The hard palate and tongue, and strong teeth and jaws of this
  latter quadruped enable him to break off and masticate tough and thorny
  branches as large as the finger. He is particularly fond of the smaller
  twigs, leaves, and seed-pods of the <i>Sont</i> and other acacias, which,
  like the American robinia, thrive well on dry and sandy soils, and he
  spares no tree the branches of which are within his reach, except, if I
  remember right, the tamarisk that produces manna. Young trees sprout
  plentifully around the springs and along the winter water-courses of the
  desert, and these are just the halting stations of the caravans and their
  routes of travel. In the shade of these trees annual grasses and
  perennial shrubs shoot up, but are mown down by the hungry cattle of the
  Bedouin as fast as they grow. A few years of undisturbed vegetation would
  suffice to cover such points with groves, and these would gradually
  extend themselves over soils where now scarcely any green thing but the
  bitter colocynth and the poisonous foxglove is ever seen."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_122" href="#NtA_122">[122]</a> On Petermann's map of
  Africa, in <i>Stieler's Hand-Atlas</i> (1879), the Island of Ascension is
  shown as seated on a much larger and shallower submarine bank than St.
  Helena. The 1,000 fathom line round Ascension encloses an oval space 170
  miles long by 70 wide, and even the 300 fathom line, one over 60 miles
  long; and it is therefore probable that a much larger island once
  occupied this site. Now Ascension is nearly equidistant between St.
  Helena and Liberia, and such an island might have served as an
  intermediate station through which many of the immigrants to St. Helena
  passed. As the distances are hardly greater than in the case of the
  Azores, this removes whatever difficulty may have been felt of the
  possibility of <i>any</i> organisms reaching so remote an island. The
  present island of Ascension is probably only the summit of a huge
  volcanic mass, and any remnant of the original fauna and flora it might
  have preserved may have been destroyed by great volcanic eruptions. Mr.
  Darwin collected some masses of tufa which were found to be mainly
  organic, containing, besides remains of fresh-water infusoria, the
  siliceous tissue of plants! In the light of the great extent of the
  submarine bank on which the island stands, Mr. Darwin's remark,
  that&mdash;"we may feel sure, that at some former epoch, the climate and
  productions of Ascension were very different from what they are
  now,"&mdash;has received a striking confirmation. (See <i>Naturalist's

  of the Hawaiian flora is the extraordinary development of what are
  usually herbaceous plants into shrubs or trees. Three species of Viola
  are shrubs from three to five feet high. A shrubby Silene is nearly as
  tall; and an allied endemic genus, Schiedea, has numerous shrubby
  species. <i>Geranium arboreum</i> is sometimes twelve feet high. The
  endemic Compositæ are mostly shrubs, while several are trees reaching
  twenty or thirty feet in height. The numerous Lobeliaceæ, all endemic,
  are mostly shrubs or trees, often resembling palms or yuccas in habit,
  and sometimes twenty-five or thirty feet high. The only native genus of
  Primulaceæ&mdash;Lysimachia&mdash;consists mainly of shrubs; and even a
  plantain has a woody stem sometimes six feet high.</p>

  for this curious fact.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_138" href="#NtA_138">[138]</a> The following remarks by
  Dr. Richard Spruce, who has made a special study of mosses and especially
  of hepaticæ, are of interest. "From what precedes, I conclude that no
  existing agency is capable of transporting the germs of our hepatics of
  tropical type from the torrid zone to Britain, and I venture to suppose
  that their existence at Killarney dates from the remote period when the
  vegetation of the whole northern hemisphere partook of a tropical
  character. If I am challenged to account for their survival through the
  last glacial period, I reply that, granting even the existence of a
  universal ice-cap down to the latitude of 40° in America and 50° in
  Europe, it is not to be assumed that the whole extent, even of land, was
  <i>perennially</i> entombed 'in thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice.'
  Towards the southern margin of the ice the climate was probably very
  similar to that of Greenland and the northern part of Norway at the
  present day. The summer sun would have great power, and on the borders of
  sheltered fjords the frozen snow would disappear completely, if only for
  a very short period, and I ask only for a month or two, not doubting the
  capacity of our hepatics to survive in a dormant state under the snow for
  at least ten months in the year. I have gathered mosses in the Pyrenees
  where the snow had barely left them on August 2nd; by September 25th they
  were re-covered with snow, and would not be again uncovered till the
  following year. The mosses of Killarney might even enjoy a longer summer
  than this; for the gulf-stream laves both sides of the south-western
  angle of Ireland, and its tepid waters would exert great melting power on
  the ice-bound coast, preventing at the same time any formation of ice in
  the sea itself." This passage is the conclusion of a very interesting
  discussion on the distribution of hepaticæ in a paper on "A New Hepatic
  from Killarney," in the <i>Journal of Botany</i>, vol. 25, (Feb. 1887),
  pp. 33-82, in which many curious facts are given as to the habits and
  distribution of these curious and beautiful little plants.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_139" href="#NtA_139">[139]</a> While these pages are
  passing through the press I am informed by my friend Mr. W.&nbsp;H. Beeby that
  in the Shetland Isles, where he has been collecting for five summers, he
  has found several plants new to the British flora, and a few altogether
  undescribed. Among these latter is a very distinct species of Hieracium
  (<i>H. Zetlandicum</i>), which is quite unknown in Scandinavia, and is
  almost certainly peculiar to the British Islands. Here we have another
  proof that entirely new species are still to be discovered in the remoter
  portions of our country.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_140" href="#NtA_140">[140]</a> In the first edition of
  this work the numbers were 400 and 340, showing the great increase of our
  knowledge during the last ten years, chiefly owing to the researches of
  Mr. A.&nbsp;H. Everett in Sarawak and Mr. John Whitehead in North Borneo and
  the great mountain Kini Balu.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_148" href="#NtA_148">[148]</a> Captain Blakiston has shown
  that the northern island&mdash;Yezo&mdash;is much more temperate and less
  peculiar in its zoology than the central and southern islands. This is no
  doubt dependent chiefly on the considerable change of climate that occurs
  on passing the Tsu-garu strait.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_149" href="#NtA_149">[149]</a> See Dr. J.&nbsp;E. Gray's
  "Revision of the Viverridæ," in <i>Proc. Zool. Soc.</i> 1864, p. 507.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_150" href="#NtA_150">[150]</a> Some of the Bats of
  Madagascar and East Africa are said to have their nearest allies in
  Australia. (See Dobson in <i>Nature</i>, Vol. XXX. p. 575.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_151" href="#NtA_151">[151]</a> This view was, I believe,
  first advanced by Professor Huxley in his "Anniversary Address to the
  Geological Society," in 1870. He says:&mdash;"In fact the Miocene
  mammalian fauna of Europe and the Himalayan regions contain, associated
  together, the types which are at present separately located in the South
  African and Indian provinces of Arctogæa. Now there is every reason to
  believe, on other grounds, that both Hindostan south of the Ganges, and
  Africa south of the Sahara, were separated by a wide sea from Europe and
  North Asia during the Middle and Upper Eocene epochs. Hence it becomes
  highly probable that the well-known similarities, and no less remarkable
  differences, between the present faunæ of India and South Africa have
  arisen in some such fashion as the following: Some time during the
  Miocene epoch, the bottom of the nummulitic sea was upheaved and
  converted into dry land in the direction of a line extending from
  Abyssinia to the mouth of the Ganges. By this means the Dekkan on the one
  hand and South Africa on the other, became connected with the Miocene dry
  land and with one another. The Miocene mammals spread gradually over this
  intermediate dry land; and if the condition of its eastern and western
  ends offered as wide contrasts as the valleys of the Ganges and Arabia do
  now, many forms which made their way into Africa must have been different
  from those which reached the Dekkan, while others might pass into both
  these sub-provinces."</p>

  <p>This question is fully discussed in my <i>Geographical Distribution of
  Animals</i> (Vol. I., p. 285), where I expressed views somewhat different
  from those of Professor Huxley, and made some slight errors which are
  corrected in the present work. As I did not then refer to Professor
  Huxley's prior statement of the theory of Miocene immigration into Africa
  (which I had read but the reference to which I could not recall) I am
  happy to give his views here.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_152" href="#NtA_152">[152]</a> The total number of
  Madagascar birds is 238, of which 129 are absolutely peculiar to the
  island, as are thirty-five of the genera. All the peculiar birds but two
  are land birds. These are the numbers given in M. Grandidier's great work
  on Madagascar.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_154" href="#NtA_154">[154]</a> In a paper read before the
  Geological Society in 1874, Mr. H.&nbsp;F. Blanford, from the similarity of
  the fossil plants and reptiles, supposed that India and South Africa had
  been connected by a continent, "and remained so connected with some short
  intervals from the Permian up to the end of the Miocene period," and Mr.
  Woodward expressed his satisfaction with "this further evidence derived
  from the fossil flora of the Mesozoic series of India in corroboration of
  the former existence of an old submerged continent&mdash;Lemuria."</p>

  <p>Those who have read the preceding chapters of the present work will
  not need to have pointed out to them how utterly inconclusive is the
  fragmentary evidence derived from such remote periods (even if there were
  no evidence on the other side) as indicating geographical changes. The
  notion that a similarity in the productions of widely separated
  continents at any past epoch is only to be explained by the existence of
  a <i>direct</i> land-connection, is entirely opposed to all that we know
  of the wide and varying distribution of <i>all</i> types at different
  periods, as well as to the great powers of dispersal over moderate widths
  of ocean possessed by all animals except mammalia. It is no less opposed
  to what is now known of the general permanency of the great continental
  and oceanic areas; while in this particular case it is totally
  inconsistent (as has been shown above) with the actual facts of the
  distribution of animals.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_161" href="#NtA_161">[161]</a> In Maillard's <i>Notes sur
  l'Isle de Réunion</i>, a considerable number of mammalia are given as
  "wild," such as <i>Lemur mongoz</i> and <i>Centetes setosus</i>, both
  Madagascar species, with such undoubtedly introduced animals as a wild
  cat, a hare, and several rats and mice. He also gives two species of
  frogs, seven lizards, and two snakes. The latter are both Indian species
  and certainly imported, as are most probably the frogs. Legouat, who
  resided some years in the island nearly two centuries ago, and who was a
  closer observer of nature, mentions numerous birds, large bats,
  land-tortoises, and lizards, but no other reptiles or venomous animals
  except scorpions. We may be pretty sure, therefore, that the
  land-mammalia, snakes, and frogs, now found wild, have all been
  introduced. Of lizards, on the other hand, there are several species,
  some peculiar to the island, others common to Africa and the other
  Mascarene Islands. The following list by Prof. Dumeril is given in
  Maillard's work:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Four species of chameleon are now recorded from Bourbon and one from
  Mauritius (J. Reay Greene, M.D., in <i>Pop. Science Rev.</i> April,
  1880), but as they are not mentioned by the old writers, it is pretty
  certain that these creatures are recent introductions, and this is the
  more probable as they are favourite domestic pets.</p>

  <p>Darwin informed me that in a work entitled <i>Voyage à l'Isle de
  France, par un Officier du Roi</i>, published in 1770, it is stated that
  a fresh-water fish had been introduced from Batavia and had multiplied.
  The writer also says (p. 170): "<i>On a essayé, mais sans succcès, d'y
  transporter des grenouilles qui mangent les &oelig;ufs que les moustigues
  deposent sur les eaux stagnantes.</i>" It thus appears that there were
  then no frogs on the island.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_162" href="#NtA_162">[162]</a> That the dodo is really an
  abortion from a more perfect type, and not a direct development from some
  lower form of wingless bird, is shown by its possessing a keeled sternum,
  though the keel is exceedingly reduced, being only three-quarters of an
  inch deep in a length of seven inches. The most terrestrial
  pigeon&mdash;the Didunculus of the Samoan Islands, has a far deeper and
  better developed keel, showing that in the case of the dodo the
  degradation has been extreme. We have also analogous examples in other
  extinct birds of the same group of islands, such as the flightless
  Rails&mdash;Aphanapteryx of Mauritius and Erythromachus of Rodriguez, as
  well as the large parrot&mdash;Lophopsittacus of Mauritius, and the Night
  Heron, <i>Nycticorax megacephala</i> of Rodriguez, the last two birds
  probably having been able to fly a little. The commencement of the same
  process is to be seen in the peculiar dove of the Seychelles, <i>Turtur
  rostratus</i>, which, as Mr. Edward Newton has shown, has much shorter
  wings than its close ally, <i>T. picturatus</i>, of Madagascar. For a
  full and interesting account of these and other recently extinct birds
  see Professor Newton's article on "Fossil Birds" in the <i>Encyclopædia
  Britannica</i>, ninth edition, vol. iii., p. 732; and that on "The
  Extinct Birds of Rodriguez," by Dr. A. Günther and Mr. E. Newton, in the
  Royal Society's volume on the Transit of Venus Expedition.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_165" href="#NtA_165">[165]</a> This brief account of the

  Captain Cook as having been seen at Pickersgill Harbour in Dusky Bay
  (Cook's 2nd Voyage, Vol. I. p. 98) may have been the same creature. He
  says, "A four-footed animal was seen by three or four of our people, but
  as no two gave the same description of it, I cannot say what kind it is.
  All, however, agreed that it was about the size of a cat, with short
  legs, and of a mouse colour. One of the seamen, and he who had the best
  view of it, said it had a bushy tail, and was the most like a jackal of
  any animal he knew." It is suggestive that, so far as the points on which
  "all agreed"&mdash;the size and the dark colour&mdash;this description
  would answer well to the animal so recently seen, while the "short legs"
  correspond to the otter-like tracks, and the thick tail of an otter-like
  animal may well have appeared "bushy" when the fur was dry. It has been
  suggested that it was only one of the native dogs; but as none of those
  who saw it took it for a dog, and the points on which they all agreed are
  not dog-like, we can hardly accept this explanation; while the actual
  existence of an unknown animal in New Zealand of corresponding size and
  colour is confirmed by this account of a similar animal having been seen
  about a century ago.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_174" href="#NtA_174">[174]</a> The recent existence of the
  Moa and its having been exterminated by the Maoris appears to be at
  length set at rest by the statement of Mr. John White, a gentleman who
  has been collecting materials for a history of the natives for
  thirty-five years, who has been initiated by their priests into all their
  mysteries, and is said to "know more about the history, habits, and
  customs of the Maoris than they do themselves." His information on this
  subject was obtained from old natives long before the controversy on the
  subject arose. He says that the histories and songs of the Maoris abound
  in allusions to the Moa, and that they were able to give full accounts of
  "its habits, food, the season of the year it was killed, its appearance,
  strength, and all the numerous ceremonies which were enacted by the
  natives before they began the hunt, the mode of hunting, how cut up, how
  cooked, and what wood was used in the cooking, with an account of its
  nest, and how the nest was made, where it usually lived, &amp;c." Two
  pages are occupied by these details, but they are only given from memory,
  and Mr. White promises a full account from his MSS. Many of the details
  given correspond with facts ascertained from the discovery of native
  cooking places with Moas' bones; and it seems quite incredible that such
  an elaborate and detailed account should be all invention. (See
  <i>Transactions of the New Zealand Institute</i>, Vol. VIII. p. 79.)</p>

  Australian genera (<i>Orthonyx</i> and <i>Tribonyx</i>) as occurring in
  New Zealand. But the former has been found in New Guinea, while the New
  Zealand bird is considered to form a distinct genus, <i>Clitonyx</i>; and
  the latter inhabits Tasmania, and was recorded from New Zealand through
  an error. (See <i>Ibis</i>, 1873, p. 427.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_178" href="#NtA_178">[178]</a> The peculiar genera of
  Australian lizards according to Boulenger's British Museum Catalogue, are

  <p><a name="Nt_179" href="#NtA_179">[179]</a> These figures are taken
  from Mr. G.&nbsp;M. Thomson's address "On the Origin of the New Zealand
  Flora," <i>Trans. N.&nbsp;Z. Institute</i>, XIV. (1881), being the latest that
  I can obtain. They differ somewhat from those given in the first edition,
  but not so as to affect the conclusions drawn from them.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_180" href="#NtA_180">[180]</a> This accords with the
  general scarcity of Leguminosæ in Oceanic Islands, due probably to their
  usually dry and heavy seeds, not adapted to any of the forms of aërial
  transmission; and it would indicate either that New Zealand was never
  absolutely united with Australia, or that the union was at a very remote
  period when Leguminosæ were either not differentiated or comparatively
  rare.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_181" href="#NtA_181">[181]</a> Sir Joseph Hooker informs
  me that the number of tropical Australian plants discovered within the
  last twenty years is very great, and that the statement as above made may
  have to be modified. Looking, however, at the enormous disproportion of
  the figures given in the "Introductory Essay" in 1859 (2,200 tropical to
  5,800 temperate species) it seems hardly possible that a great difference
  should not still exist, at all events as regards species. In Baron von
  Müeller's latest summary of the Australian Flora (<i>Second Systematic
  Census of Australian Plants</i>, 1889), he gives the total species at
  8,839, of which 3,560 occur in West Australia, and 3,251 in New South
  Wales. On counting the species common to these two colonies in fifty
  pages of the <i>Census</i> taken at random, I find them to be about
  one-tenth of the total species in both. This would give the number of
  distinct species in these areas as about 6,130. Adding to these the
  species peculiar to Victoria and South Australia, we shall have a flora
  of near 6,500 in the temperate parts of Australia. It is true that West
  Australia extends far into the tropics, but an overwhelming majority of
  the species have been discovered in the south-western portion of the
  colony, while the species that may be exclusively tropical will be more
  than balanced by those of temperate Queensland, which have not been taken
  account of, as that colony is half temperate and half tropical. It thus
  appears probable that full three fourths of the species of Australian
  plants occur in the temperate regions, and are mainly characteristic of
  it. Sir Joseph Hooker also doubts the generally greater richness of
  tropical over temperate floras which I have taken as almost an axiom. He
  says: "Taking similar areas to Australia in the Western World,
  <i>e.g.</i>, tropical Africa north of 20° S. Lat. as against temperate
  Africa and Europe up to 47°&mdash;I suspect that the latter would present
  more genera and species than the former." This, however, appears to me to
  be hardly a case in point, because Europe is a distinct continent from
  Africa and has had a very different past history, and it is not a fair
  comparison to take the tropical area in one continent while the temperate
  is made up of widely separated areas in two continents. A closer parallel
  may perhaps be found in equal areas of Brazil and south temperate
  America, or of Mexico and the Southern United States, in both of which
  cases I suppose there can be little doubt that the tropical areas are far
  the richest. Temperate South Africa is, no doubt, always quoted as richer
  than an equal area of tropical Africa or perhaps than any part of the
  world of equal extent, but this is admitted to be an exceptional
  case.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_182" href="#NtA_182">[182]</a> Sir Joseph Hooker thinks
  that later discoveries in the Australian Alps and other parts of East and
  South Australia may have greatly modified or perhaps reversed the above
  estimate, and the figures given in the preceding note indicate that this
  is so. But still, the small area of South-west Australia will be,
  proportionally, far the richer of the two. It is much to be desired that
  the enormous mass of facts contained in Mr. Bentham's <i>Flora
  Australiensis</i> and Baron von Müeller's <i>Census</i> should be
  tabulated and compared by some competent botanist, so as to exhibit the
  various relations of its wonderful vegetation in the same manner as was
  done by Sir Joseph Hooker with the materials available twenty-one years
  ago.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_183" href="#NtA_183">[183]</a> From an examination of the
  fossil corals of the South-west of Victoria, Professor P.&nbsp;M. Duncan
  concludes&mdash;"that, at the time of the formation of these deposits the
  central area of Australia was occupied by sea, having open water to the
  north, with reefs in the neighbourhood of Java." The age of these fossils
  is not known, but as almost all are extinct species, and some are almost
  identical with European Pliocene and Miocene species, they are supposed
  to belong to a corresponding period. (<i>Journal of Geol. Soc.</i>,
  1870.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_186" href="#NtA_186">[186]</a> The large collection of
  fossil plants from the Tertiary beds of New Zealand which have been
  recently described by Baron von Ettingshausen (<i>Trans. N.&nbsp;Z. Inst.</i>,
  vol. xxiii., pp. 237-310), prove that a change in the vegetation has
  occurred similar to that which has taken place in Eastern Australia, and
  that the plants of the two countries once resembled each other more than
  they do now. We have, first, a series of groups now living in Australia,
  but which have become extinct in New Zealand, as Cassia, Dalbergia,
  Eucalyptus, Diospyros, Dryandra, Casuarina, and Ficus; and also such
  northern genera as Acer, Planera, Ulmus, Quercus, Alnus, Myrica, and
  Sequoia. All these latter, except Ulmus and Planera, have been found also
  in the Eastern-Australian Tertiaries, and we may therefore consider that
  at this period the northern temperate element in both floras was
  identical. If this flora entered both countries from the south, and was
  really Antarctic, its extinction in New Zealand may have been due to the
  submergence of the country to the south, and its elevation and extension
  towards the tropics, admitting of the incursion of the large number of
  Polynesian and tropical Australian types now found there; while the
  Australian portion of the same flora may have succumbed at a somewhat
  later period, when the elevation of the Cretaceous and Tertiary sea
  united it with Western Australia, and allowed the rich typical Australian
  flora to overrun the country. Of course we are assuming that the
  identification of these genera is for the most part correct, though
  almost entirely founded on leaves only. Fuller knowledge, both of the
  extinct flora itself and of the geological age of the several deposits,
  is requisite before any trustworthy explanation of the phenomena can be
  arrived at.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_188" href="#NtA_188">[188]</a> Insects are tolerably
  abundant in the open mountain regions, but very scarce in the forests.
  Mr. Meyrick says that these are "strangely deficient in insects, the same
  species occurring throughout the islands;" and Mr. Pascoe remarked that
  "the forests of New Zealand were the most barren country,
  entomologically, he had ever visited." (<i>Proc. Ent. Soc.</i>, 1883. p.

  <p><a name="Nt_191" href="#NtA_191">[191]</a> As this is a point of great
  interest in its bearing on the dispersal of plants by means of mountain
  ranges, I have endeavoured to obtain a few illustrative facts:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Mr. William Mitten, of Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, informs me that when
  the London and Brighton railway was in progress in his neighbourhood,
  <i>Melilotus vulgaris</i> made its appearance on the banks, remained for
  several years, and then altogether disappeared. Another case is that of
  <i>Diplotaxis muralis</i>, which formerly occurred only near the
  sea-coast of Sussex, and at Lewes; but since the railway was made has
  spread along it, and still maintains itself abundantly on the railway
  banks though rarely found anywhere else.</p>

  <p>2. A correspondent in Tasmania informs me that whenever the virgin
  forest is cleared in that island there invariably comes up a thick crop
  of a plant locally known as fire-weed&mdash;a species of Senecio,
  probably <i>S. Australis</i>. It never grows except where the fire has
  gone over the ground, and is unknown except in such places. My
  correspondent adds:&mdash;"This autumn I went back about thirty-five
  miles through a dense forest, along a track marked by some prospectors
  the year before, and in one spot where they had camped, and the fire had
  burnt the fallen logs, &amp;c., there was a fine crop of 'fire-weed.' All
  around for many miles was a forest of the largest trees and dense scrub."
  Here we have a case in which burnt soil and ashes favour the germination
  of a particular plant, whose seeds are easily carried by the wind, and it
  is not difficult to see how this peculiarity might favour the dispersal
  of the species for enormous distances, by enabling it temporarily to grow
  and produce seeds on burnt spots.</p>

  <p>3. In answer to an inquiry on this subject, Mr. H.&nbsp;C. Watson has been
  kind enough to send me a detailed account of the progress of vegetation
  on the railway banks and cuttings about Thames Ditton. This account is
  written from memory, but as Mr. Watson states that he took a great
  interest in watching the process year by year, there can be no reason to
  doubt the accuracy of his memory. I give a few extracts which bear
  especially on the subject we are discussing.</p>

  <p>"One rather remarkable biennial plant appeared early (the second year,
  as I recollect) and renewed itself either two or three years, namely,
  <i>Isatis tinctoria</i>&mdash;a species usually supposed, to be one of
  our introduced, but pretty well naturalised, plants. The nearest stations
  then or since known to me for this <i>Isatis</i> are on chalk about
  Guildford, twenty miles distant. There were two or three plants of it at
  first, never more than half a dozen. Once since I saw a plant of
  <i>Isatis</i> on the railway bank near Vauxhall.</p>

  <p>"Close by Ditton Station three species appeared which may be called
  interlopers. The biennial <i>Barbarea precox</i>, one of these, is the
  least remarkable, because it might have come as seed in the earth from
  some garden, or possibly in the Thames gravel (used as ballast). At first
  it increased to several plants, then became less numerous, and will soon,
  in all probability, become extinct, crowded out by other plants. The
  biennial <i>Petroselinum segetum</i> was at first one very luxuriant
  plant on the slope of the embankment. It increased by seed into a dozen
  or a score, and is now nearly if not quite extinct. The third species is
  <i>Linaria purpurea</i>, not strictly a British plant, but one
  established in some places on old walls. A single root of it appeared on
  the chalk facing of the embankment by Ditton Station. It has remained
  there several years and grown into a vigorous specimen. Two or three
  smaller examples are now seen by it, doubtless sprung from some of the
  hundreds or thousands of seeds shed by the original one plant. The
  species is not included in Salmon and Brewer's <i>Flora of
  Surrey</i>.</p>

  <p>"The main line of the railway has introduced into Ditton parish the
  perennial <i>Arabis hirsuta</i>, likely to become a permanent inhabitant.
  The species is found on the chalk and greensand miles away from Thames
  Ditton; but neither in this parish nor in any adjacent parish, so far as
  known to myself or to the authors of the flora of the county, does it
  occur. Some years after the railway was made a single root of this
  <i>Arabis</i> was observed in the brickwork of an arch by which the
  railway is carried over a public road. A year or two afterwards there
  were three or four plants. In some later year I laid some of the ripened
  seed-pods between the bricks in places where the mortar had partly
  crumbled out. Now there are several scores of specimens in the brickwork
  of the arch. It is presumable that the first seed may have been brought
  from Guildford. But how could it get on to the perpendicular face of the
  brickwork?</p>

  <p>"The Bee Orchis (<i>Ophrys apifera</i>), plentiful on some of the
  chalk lands in Surrey, is not a species of Thames Ditton, or (as I
  presume) of any adjacent parish. Thus, I was greatly surprised some years
  back to see about a hundred examples of it in flower in one clayey field
  either on the outskirts of Thames Ditton or just within the limits of the
  adjoining parish of Cobham. I had crossed this same field in a former
  year without observing the Ophrys there. And on finding it in the one
  field I closely searched the surrounding fields and copses, without
  finding it anywhere else. Gradually the plants became fewer and fewer in
  that one field, and some six or eight years after its first discovery
  there the species had quite disappeared again. I guessed it had been
  introduced with chalk, but could obtain no evidence to show this."</p>

  <p>4. Mr. A. Bennett, of Croydon, has kindly furnished me with some
  information on the temporary vegetation of the banks and cuttings on the
  railway from Yarmouth to Caistor in Norfolk, where it passes over
  extensive sandy Denes with a sparse vegetation. The first year after the
  railway was made the banks produced abundance of <i>&OElig;nothera
  odorata</i> and <i>Delphinium Ajacis</i> (the latter only known thirty
  miles off in cornfields in Cambridgeshire), with <i>Atriplex patula</i>
  and <i>A. deltoidea</i>. Gradually the native sand plants&mdash;Carices,
  Grasses, <i>Galium verum</i>, &amp;c., established themselves, and year
  by year covered more ground till the new introductions almost completely
  disappeared. The same phenomenon was observed in Cambridgeshire between
  Chesterton and Newmarket, where, the soil being different, <i>Stellaria
  media</i> and other annuals appeared in large patches; but these soon
  gave way to a permanent vegetation of grasses, composites, &amp;c., so
  that in the third year no <i>Stellaria</i> was to be seen.</p>

  <p>5. Mr. T. Kirk (writing in 1878) states that&mdash;"in Auckland, where
  a dense sward of grass is soon formed, single specimens of the European
  milk Thistle (<i>Carduus marianus</i>) have been known for the past
  fifteen years; but although they seeded freely, the seeds had no
  opportunity of germinating, so that the thistle did not spread. A
  remarkable exception to this rule occurred during the formation of the
  Onehunga railway, where a few seeds fell on disturbed soil, grew up and
  flowered. The railway works being suspended, the plant increased rapidly,
  and spread wherever it could find disturbed soil."</p>

  <p>Again:&mdash;"The fiddle-dock (<i>Rumex pulcher</i>) occurs in great
  abundance on the formation of new streets, &amp;c., but soon becomes
  comparatively rare. It seems probable that it was one of the earliest
  plants naturalised here, but that it partially died out, its buried seeds
  retaining their vitality."</p>

  <p><i>Medicago sativa</i> and <i>Apium graveolens</i>, are also noted as
  escapes from cultivation which maintain themselves for a time but soon
  die out. (<i>Transactions of the New Zealand Institute</i>, Vol. X. p.
  367.)</p>

  <p>The preceding examples of the <i>temporary</i> establishment of plants
  on newly exposed soil, often at considerable distances from the
  localities they usually inhabit, might, no doubt, by further inquiry be
  greatly multiplied; but, unfortunately, the phenomenon has received
  little attention, and is not even referred to in the elaborate work of De
  Candolle (<i>Géographie Botanique Raisonnée</i>) in which almost every
  other aspect of the dispersion and distribution of plants is fully
  discussed. Enough has been advanced, however, to show that it is of
  constant occurrence, and from the point of view here advocated it becomes
  of great importance in explaining the almost world-wide distribution of
  many common plants of the north temperate zone.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_192" href="#NtA_192">[192]</a> Sir Joseph Hooker informs
  me that he considers these identifications worthless, and Mr. Bentham has
  also written very strongly against the value of similar identifications
  by Heer and Unger. Giving due weight to the opinions of these eminent
  botanists we must admit that Australian genera have not yet been
  <i>demonstrated</i> to have existed in Europe during the Tertiary period;
  but, on the other hand, the evidence that they did so appears to have
  some weight, on account of the improbability that the numerous
  resemblances to Australian plants which have been noticed by different
  observers should <i>all</i> be illusory; while the well established fact
  of the former wide distribution of many tropical or now restricted types
  of plants and animals, so frequently illustrated in the present volume,
  removes the antecedent improbability which is supposed to attach to such
  identifications. I am myself the more inclined to accept them, because,
  according to the views here advocated, such migrations must have taken
  place at remote as well as at recent epochs; and the preservation of some
  of these types in Australia while they have become extinct in Europe, is
  exactly paralleled by numerous facts in the distribution of animals which
  have been already referred to in Chapter XIX., and elsewhere in this
  volume, and also repeatedly in my larger work.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_193" href="#NtA_193">[193]</a> Out of forty-two genera
  from the Eocene of Sheppey enumerated by Dr. Ettingshausen in the
  <i>Geological Magazine</i> for January 1880, only two or three appear to
  be extinct, while there is a most extraordinary intermixture of tropical
  and temperate forms&mdash;Musa, Nipa, and Victoria, with Corylus, Prunus,
  Acer, &amp;c. The rich Miocene flora of Switzerland, described by
  Professor Heer, presents a still larger proportion of living genera.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_194" href="#NtA_194">[194]</a> The recent discovery by
  Lieutenant Jensen of a rich flora on rocky peaks rising out of the
  continental ice of Greenland, as well as the abundant vegetation of the
  highest northern latitudes, renders it possible that even now the
  Antarctic continent may not be wholly destitute of vegetation, although
  its climate and physical condition are far less favourable than those of
  the Arctic lands. (See <i>Nature</i>, Vol. XXI. p. 345.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_195" href="#NtA_195">[195]</a> Dr. Hector notes the
  occurrence of the genus <i>Dammara</i> in Triassic deposits, while in the
  Jurassic period New Zealand possessed the genera <i>Palæozamia</i>,
  <i>Oleandrium</i>, <i>Alethopteris</i>, <i>Camptopteris</i>,
  <i>Cycadites</i>, <i>Echinostrobus</i>, &amp;c., all Indian forms of the
  same age. Neocomian beds contain a true dicotyledonous leaf with
  <i>Dammara</i> and <i>Araucaria</i>. The Cretaceous deposits have
  produced a rich flora of dicotyledonous plants, many of which are of the
  same genera as the existing flora; while the Miocene and other Tertiary
  deposits produce plants almost identical with those now inhabiting the
  country, together with many North Temperate genera which have since
  become extinct. (See p. 499, <a href="#Nt_186">footnote</a>, and
  <i>Trans. New Zealand Inst.</i>, Vol. XI. 1879, p. 536.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_196" href="#NtA_196">[196]</a> The fact stated in the last
  edition of the <i>Origin of Species</i> (p. 340) on the authority of Sir
  Joseph Hooker, that Australian plants are rapidly sowing themselves and
  becoming naturalised on the Neilgherrie mountains in the southern part of
  the Indian Peninsula, though an exception to the rule of the inability of
  Australian plants to become naturalised in the Northern Hemisphere, is
  yet quite in harmony with the hypothesis here advocated. For not only is
  the climate of the Neilgherries more favourable to Australian plants than
  any part of the North Temperate zone, but the entire Indian Peninsula has
  existed for unknown ages as an <i>island</i> and thus possesses the
  "insular" characteristic of a comparatively poor and less developed flora
  and fauna as compared with the truly "continental" Malayan and Himalayan
  regions. Australian plants are thus enabled to compete with those of the
  Indian Peninsula highlands with a fair chance of success.</p>
